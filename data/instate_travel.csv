As you know from his movie career, Zac is a 2-year-old, purebred red heeler male, about 37 pounds and high energy. After finishing his press tour for his latest movie, âMission Impossible: ACDâ, Zac came into foster care with ACDRA with the goal of retiring from the fast-paced motion picture industry and finding a forever home. Accordingly, Zacâs publicist agreed to finally let us share his full life story so far. You see, Zac was tied outside for most of his young life, with little to no interaction with people or other dogs. When his owner died, he was taken to a shelter in NC.  Zac has been in foster care on a farm with 2 other ACDs, cows, and horses. 

Although he is a bit slow to warm up to new people, Zac quickly becomes your best friend. He absolutely must be with his person at all times and gives the best body hugs ever! He has great recall and therefore a fence isnât required. He would do best with an energetic person in an active home with a yard that is dedicated to exercising him mentally and physically. Zac would make a great running, biking, or hiking partner or even agility dog. Inside the house, Zac isnât destructive (he has had free run of the house) although he does like to relocate his foster dadâs clothing around the house, and he settles right down to snuggle on your lap. He is already mostly potty trained and has learned to use the doggie door, sit, lie down, and wait. He will be easy to train as he is smart and highly food motivated. Zac loves to ride in the car and walks well on the leash. He has begun to show some interest in toys and fetch. Although Zac typically sleeps on the bed with his foster dad and canine housemates, he has occasionally been crated during the night and does just fine.  

Zac would thrive best in an ACD-experienced home without children or cats. He needs a patient person who will be able to harness his energy (and occasional mouthiness) in order help him achieve his full potential as a good canine citizen through training and exercise. Although he gets along with his foster brother and sister, they are no match for his energy level. Therefore, Zac requests a home with another dog who likes to chase and roughhouse as much as he does! 

Zac is neutered, microchipped, heartworm negative, and up to date on HW and flea/tick prevention.He is located in Adamstown, MD.

She came to use from a local shelter where her owner had turned her in.  Her owner was older and didn't have the time or energy for Tate.  She came to us with a condition called Microphthalmia.  This is where one eye is very small and often with other abnormalities.  Tate could not see out of the eye and it was uncomfortable for her.  We removed the eye which is completely healed.

Tate is very affectionate. She loves to play with toys and with other dogs.  She loves to cuddle in bed and on the sofa.  Tate is house trained and crate trained.  She loves her walks but needs more leash training.  We're working on it..   She likes to ride in the car.  Tate does sleep in bed.  She is good with respectful children that are 10 or older.  Tate would love another dog to play with but would be fine with an interactive family that has a lot of time for her.  We introduced Tate to cats and she would definitely chase if the cat would run.  It doesn't appear that she would hurt the cat but unless the cat was VERY laid back she would do best without a cat in the home.

Tate is a sweet girl that had little training in her early life.  She is very smart and eager to please.  She and her new owner would have a lot of fun in an obedience class.  Tate quickly learned to ring bells at the door to go outside but then took it a bit too far by ringing them too much.  This shows us that she is eager to have an active family that will do a lot of things where she can be included.  

Tate's adoption requirements are a fenced yard or area large enough for her to run and play that leads directly into the home.  She is not a candidate for an underground fence.  Tate needs someone who is not working a typical 8 hour work day; someone that works very part time, works from home and can their dog in their work space or someone that is retired.  She would love children that are 10 or older in the home and would do super with another playful dog.  If she is an only dog the family must be active with the time and desire to have a dog involved in a major part of their life.  After having very little attention for the first two years of her life, Tate deserves to have a home where she is cherished.  Tate's new home must continue with her natural care program.  We will place Tate within an hour drive from Akron, OH. which includes the Cleveland, Akron/Canton, Youngstown area.

Star-Mar Rescue is a natural care provider and we place our dogs in homes that are already on a natural care program or are eager to learn. We use no chemicals on our dogs, no commercial flea products (oral or topical), do blood titer testing instead of randomly vaccinating. Our yards are without fertilizer and weed killer and our homes are toxin free. We feel that dogs can be protected without being harmed by harsh chemicals and unnecessary vaccinations and do best on a species appropriate, no grain, raw diet. Frozen raw diets, freeze dried or dehydrated no grain. Raw, no grain foods are easily gotten at many pet stores and on line and are no more expensive than a high quality dry food. This simple step will provide your dog the nutrition needed to keep them healthy and happy for many years unlike feeding a lifetime of processed foods. We are happy to help with this transition. For more information go to Star-Mar Rescue Natural Care facebook page and click on \""videos\"" in the column to the left and watch the 7 part series called The Truth About Pet Cancer. It will give you an understanding of what we are doing and why. Please do some research on natural care and raw feeding and decide whether or not you are wanting to care for Tate in this manner before requesting an application.

If you feel that your lifestyle and environment meet with Tate's needs, please directly contact Martha at learymjri@aol.com or call 330-466-3667 or 330-262-0515 for an application or more information. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE LINK PROVIDED AS IT IS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE. Tate's adoption will require an approved application and a home visit, with adoption completed at her foster home in Akron, OH. Tate's adoption fee is $275. We will work to place her within an 1 hour driving distance from his foster home in Akron, OH. so that we can conduct a home visit bringing Tate with us. This includes the Cleveland, Akron/Canton, Youngstown, Elyria, Loraine areas of OH.

He kept getting away from them and coming to the foster's house. The neighbors said he could stay. And the foster would happily keep him; he's a good dog. However, this one-year-old German Shepherd mix goes after cats and doesn't really like the foster's other dog. Never having been aggressive towards people, he likes people in general as he has had successful visits to the vet and other places. We don't know for sure about children. He is an intelligent fella who needs some training; his foster feels that he hasn't been trained prior to living with him. He needs to be reminded not to jump on people when he happily greets them; he forgets that he weighs 50 pounds. Bailey might do best in a home with not other pets, and a fenced backyard would be great! (POSTED 5/26/19, R)

Just a LOVABLE little clown that ADORES hugs and frolicking with my human AND canine friends, especially my BFF and playmate, Tyris the English Mastiff, cause that stunning hunk of 200 lb love keeps me entertained all day long! We also volunteer our combined services to help Mare here in rescue by anchoring the alpha yard and thus setting the âtoneâ (ie, sterling example) for all the other dogs here in house. That's the a HIGHEST compliment possible here and one we give every effort to live up to! If you like walks, hiking or running, Iâm your girl ~ I can be the the consummate athlete OR a charming couch potato to echo YOUR choice for the day ! I enjoy all my friends at our multi dog indoor foster home and am SUPER NICE to everyone I meet ~ it always pays to be a Lady! I have a STABLE, even temperament; am CALM, intelligent, EASY to train, affectionate, extremely GENTLE and very well behaved indoors knowing thatâs the place to be kicked back. Iâm a very SWEET girl whoâs SUPER well socialized, housebroken, crate trained and I even sit nicely for treats (immediately AND without being asked, thank you very much :) I loooooove to play with toys and especially enjoy car rides and playing in the water! I have a heart of gold, and am GREAT with children because I love humans of ALL sizes. I learn REALLY quickly and love to please, especially in response to an experienced, calm, assertive pack leader that I respect. My foster Mom says Iâm the PERFECT companion because I'm BRILLIANT, live to please my human(s) and have a heart as BIG as all outdoors !!!

I'll do just about ANY thing to please you and steal your heart because I absolutely thrive on positive praise and affection :) Hey folks, life is GOOD these days and that's something I truly appreciate! I'm said to be a HAPPY, healthy, HYSTERICALLY FUNNY, outgoing, super (SUPER) smart, confident and totally ready to find my forever home! Iâm a very FRIENDLY boy who loves to run and play outside and I'm well behaved indoors, settling in nicely at your feet so we can read, nap or watch movies. My goofy facial expressions and quirkie little run (from the sheer JOY of being alive) keep everyone rolling in laughter, and I do LOVE to entertain! I also love long walks, hikes, jogging with my favorite human, or just about anything you care to do that lets us spend time together. I'm completely house, crate, car and even leash trained ~ putting my head through the loop and walking out on lead to go off for another adventure!

I'm an 2 year old neutered male American Bully (APBT with LOTS of Bulldog back blood) ~ a true âItty Bitty Pocket Pittyâ who's just a HAPPY lil guy, BRIGHT and CHEERFUL is what I'm all about 'cause I want sooooo VERY much to find a nice family who will love me and be my fur-ever home! Some people consider me âSPECIALâ with my GORGEOUS, sleek, shiny blue fur but my rescue friends assure me that MY personality truly SHINES ! With just a smidgen of TLC and training from Mare and her friends, Iâve blossomed into the DARLING LITTLE CLOWN they knew was lurking inside. I'll do just about ANY thing to please you and steal your heart because I absolutely thrive on positive praise and affection :) Hey folks, life is GOOD these days and that's something I truly appreciate! I'm said to be a HAPPY, healthy, HYSTERICALLY FUNNY, outgoing, super (SUPER) smart, confident and totally ready to find my forever home! Iâm a very FRIENDLY boy who loves to run and play outside and I'm well behaved indoors, settling in nicely at your feet so we can read, nap or watch movies. My goofy facial expressions and quirkie little run (from the sheer JOY of being alive) keep everyone rolling in laughter, and I do LOVE to entertain! I also love long walks, hikes, jogging with my favorite human, or just about anything you care to do that lets us spend time together. I'm completely house, crate, car and even leash trained ~ putting my head through the loop and walking out on lead to go off for another adventure!

I love to lay at your feet and play with my bone(s) or favorite toys and especially enjoy car rides where I sit nicely to take in the scenery! I have a heart of gold, learn really quickly and love to please my people. There's also a LOT of other dogs here so I'm highly socialized so I've even made peace with Ms Sadie, the fairly bossy high Priestess of Bulldogs on this ranch and thoroughly enjoy spending my time and life with my devoted canine companion, the most handsome, Mr Win, who is ever so debonair with his dapper tuxedo coat! Mare says Iâm the PERFECT breed ambassador, a GREAT companion and friend because I have a LOVELY disposition and a heart as big as all outdoors!

Iâm a pure bred, 4 year old, spayed female American Bully (Amstaff with LOTS of Bulldog back blood) who's REALLY gentle AND patient ! I'm just a EASY GOING, calm, KIND-HEARTED soul who loves to hang out with my humans and the consummate house dog who knows how to behave like a true LADY, both indoors AND out! Typical of the original Bully breedings, I have a STABLE, even temperament so I'm CALM, highly INTELLIGENT, easy to train, AFFECTIONATE, extremely GENTLE and very WELL BEHAVED indoors knowing thatâs the place to be kicked back. So Iâm known to be a super sweet girl who is amazingly well socialized, housebroken, crate trained (though I certainly don't need one) and even sit for treats and/or attention (automatically and without being asked, thank you very much). I love to lay at your feet and play with my bone(s) or favorite toys and especially enjoy car rides where I sit nicely to take in the scenery! I have a heart of gold, learn really quickly and love to please my people. There's also a LOT of other dogs here so I'm highly socialized so I've even made peace with Ms Sadie, the fairly bossy high Priestess of Bulldogs on this ranch and thoroughly enjoy spending my time and life with my devoted canine companion, the most handsome, Mr Win, who is ever so debonair with his dapper tuxedo coat! Mare says Iâm the PERFECT breed ambassador, a GREAT companion and friend because I have a LOVELY disposition and a heart as big as all outdoors! Iâm just happy sheâs so pleased with me, but then Iâm a happy kinda gal anyway ~ serene and cheerful is what Iâm all about! I'm SUPER SMART, love to learn new things and do my utmost to be the BESTEST GIRL you'll ever meet because I'm absolutely DEVOTED to pleasing my human(s).

While not all are in the immediate area, once we have processed and approved your application, we will move the dog to our adoptive area for you to meet, greet and hopefully adopt. Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE- OSCAR IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION. PLEASE SEE CONTACT INFO BELOW. Oscar is very good with people. He has only met other dogs through a fence so he will be slowly introduced to other dogs soon to get a better idea of how he does with them. He barks at them initially and then calms down but further dog testing will be needed after he is neutered. Oscar is a sweet boy that loves car rides and wants a family to call his own. He is unusually beautiful and appears to have been well taken care of. Oscar is located in Allegheny County, MD.

I am an energetic, talkative, funny Siberian Husky girl looking for my forever home.  I am looking for a home that has experience in huskies, that is very energetic and that will keep up with my training.

My story:

I was brought here from Animal control down by Detroit MI. I was adopted once from there but brought back due to some pretty sever issues that landed me on what is called the Euthanization list. I am not sure what that means, all I know is that I have heard that it  isn't a good thing. The person at animal control along with another individual did not feel I should be euthanized. They found this lady at the rescue I am at now, and the rest is history.
       When I arrived here, I had absolutely NO training.  I also had the \""MINE\"" complex, meaning what is mine is mine, what is yours is mine and I owned everything. I certainly felt I did not need to do anything that was asked of me.  I knew a few basic commands but I wouldnt do them unless there was something in it for me. Yes, some of this is husky behavior, however, mine was to the extreme. Should anyone have tried to take something from me that I felt was mine ( and everything was mine) I would behave badly and sometimes bite them. HOWEVER,
       After a year of rehabilitation, leadership, training and desensitization with things I am a very well rounded girl. I know my basic commands such as, sit, wait, leave it, down, off, stay, bring it and shake. My foster mommy said I never had any direction in my life or leadership causing me to  act out badly and develop the \""mine\"" complex to the extreme. 
        My foster mommy can now place her hand into my food dish with food and I will eat around her hand ( I also had issues with being possessive over my food while in the dish). She can safely take things out of my mouth like toys, bones and anything else I decide to put into it that she needs to fish out (yup, now that  is my NORMAL husky behavior showing up). She has desensitized, me from everything she can think of, given me direction, training and leadership. 
        I am playful, I love to play fetch although, there are times when the bring the toy back consists of me bringing the toy to my foster mom , me waiting for her to get close and taking off with the toy. Its a fun game!
        I like to play with other dogs but I can be overbearing and dominant with some dogs. I do best with other male dogs but I can do well  with other females with proper introductions. NO CATS or small animals (chickens etc)  however,  DO have a very high prey drive! 
        I like to go for car rides, and I ride very well in a vehicle . I walk well on the leash now with minimal corrections unless I see something that gets me really excited. I know my basic commands such as sit, stay, down, off, leave it, shake and bring it (still working on that!). I also am a talker and most of the time I never shut up! 
        If you would like to learn even more about me please contact my foster mommy through this site! Im sure she will talk forever about me!  

You can also apply to meet me at www.fewstepsfromhome.com and follow the link to the meet and greet/pre-adoption application.

Hope to meet you soon! oh, bring treats! Im VERY treat motivated!! 

PS. no young kids please

There are also cats in their foster home for any adopters that do have a kitty, they are already introduced!

Tucker came with the litter of 3mo olds that were pulled by us from a more remote shelter in Arizona. He came with 18 other huskies that were all saved from the same neglectful home. Our rescue was able to pull 12 of them. All of the dogs in this litter do great with other dogs, but some are a little more skittish with people at first. They seem to warm up and become very snuggly and loving for the most part, but definitely would benefit from longterm socialization work.

According to his foster, Tucker is completely potty trained in their home (new changes like a home move can sometimes back this process up a little, so as with all puppies, some patience may be required). The fosters are working on crate-training still, as well as taking treats more gently â Tucker has been showing some good progress with this. Tucker is the more snuggly, loving dog of the two puppies in the foster home. He also loves to play with other dogs!

Gunner is a very playful active little guy. He is always ready to go anywhere and just loves being around people and other dogs. So far gunner has enjoyed camping, hiking, 4wheeling and nightly walks with his foster brothers. Gunner has been great in the crate while we are at work. Gunner will get into anything so you will need to keep your eyes on him. He seems to have a stubborn personality so not getting him to chew on things or potty training has been rough but he seems to be getting better. This little guy needs someone who loves being active and loves being on the go. He seems to love kids and especially other dogs.

Roman can be very pushy with other dogs so weâre recommending he goes as the only dog in the home. He takes a little longer to warm up to men than women but is a total love bug once he gets to know you. Roman came from a pretty rough situation, where he was kept in a kennel much too small for him, outside in the Arizona heat for almost two years.

Roman is kennel trained, house trained and formally trained in obedience. He knows how to walk nicely on a leash, sit and stay, lay down and stay, how to find the heel position and come when called.

Zulu is an older, medium sized cattle dog mix who is affectionate, loyal, hyper-aware and active. She loves to go on walks and hikes with her humans, chew on her Nylabones and rawhide treats, as well as spend time with her fellow dogs and cats. Zulu is very good with children and other animals (she is reluctant to get to know larger dogs, but has so in the past). 

Zulu dislikes loud, sudden noises and busy areas. This tends to lead to excessive barking. She also dislikes being separated from her humans and prefers to hang out with them all the time! 

At the moment, Zulu's current owners live in a very busy neighborhood, on a very busy intersection. The move to this location has taken a toll on Zulu's mental wellbeing and her current humans would love to find a quiet, loving home for her to spend her golden years in! She is spayed and is current on her vaccines. 

Zulu is located in Tucson, Arizona. You may reach her owner at acespino888@gmail.com or (520)440-5575."

NOT IN THE SHELTER ~ Fostering in Ward, Ar 501-259-1065

Hi, my name is Wilma! I am a puppy hound of about 4-5 months. My foster momma calls me a happy hound! HEHE and I am. I really love when momma is able to sit with me...gives me hugs and kisses! I love hanging out playing with my sisters and brother, the ranch cats and some of the other dogs. I like meeting new people of all ages and really like when we get to hang out with foster dad while he watches TV

We all came from rural Arkansas...we was pretty hungry and unsettled due to fending for ourselves in the wild! Foster parents helped us right quick by feeding us plenty of good eats, soft beds and lots of toys to play with.

Now I am ready to become your princess and best gal dog friend. At night I lay in my dog bed dreaming of our hikes, swimming, playing fetch and snuggling up to watch Foot Ball! I just need you to love me...like I am gonna love you! Please fill out my application or contact my foster momma for more details"

When she first arrived in rescue she was incredibly shy and not at all used to the idea of living inside and would desperatly try to stay outside. Luckily she has an amazing and patient foster who slowly eased her into being an inside dog little by little. Now Britt, while still shy, is getting used to indoor luxuries. She loves to play with her foster brother and sister, exploring the yard and chasing each other. She has enjoyed several toys that they've given her and has figured out how to really play but alsoappreciates her quiet time indoors. She is potty trained, but due to her skittish nature has not been introduced to a crate as she has not needed one. She has done well with the other dogs in the home, but will not be adopted to a home with kids or small animals. She has done well with the infant in the home, but because her background is unknown and interactions have been limited, we are not comfotable adopting her to a home with small kids. The best home for Britt would be a quiet home that wants a companion that is playful, but also happy to chill in the house.

If you are interested in adopting Britt, you csn complete an adoption application here on our website."

If youâre looking for a best friend that wants to please you and be your #1 sidekick, this little girl is for you!  Being 10 weeks old, sheâs energetic, full of life and curiosity.  Having spent just a short time in her foster home, Pepper has no fear of her extra large fur siblings and is quite fond of her younger human siblings, though she might be a bit too active for toddlers and younger kids.  Sheâs learning to fetch a ball and is doing quite well with this skill so far!  Anticipated to be 40-50 lbs, this puppy will require lots of exercise and playtime.  Does she sound like the perfect fit for you? Apply now!

I am Elle and I am a 15 wk, 20 plus pounds of energized Great Dane puppy. I was told I was the runt of the litter so I will probably be on the smaller end of size for a Great Dane. I have two speeds- full steam ahead or sound asleep. I am trying to learn manners and know sit and down: I go to daycare to keep my smart little brain growing. I am very good at daycare and play well with others. I can have an aloof personality with strangers so it is going to be very important that I am socialized all the time. I am all baby so I harass and torment the elderly Shih tzu and cats in the house without mercy. So for the sanity of my future family, I probably donât need cats in my new home. I would love fur siblings but they need to be saints with patience beyond measure. I am trying to learn the body language when another dog wants me to stop biting them with my sharp puppy teeth. Sometimes, I am a little slow on the translation so I need a fur sibling that wonât get to upset with me during my learning curve. I am crate trained and doing well on housebreaking when taken outside on a regular basis for potty breaks. I am not ready or old enough to be left at home for 8-9 hrs a day in a crate. I will need someone home often. 
I am going to be big so I think it is in my best interest to go to a home with large dog experience. Cute, undisciplined, puppy antics turn into unmanageable, unwanted behavior when I am 100 lb adult. 
If you want a loving, sweet, smart, funny, high energy, going to be large adult, best friend please complete an application for me

Sheâs good walking on a leash, riding in the car and is housetrained. Sheâs great with kids (over 8 years old because she startles with loud noises and sudden movements).  She loves playing with other dogs and would be happy in a home with another dog or as an âonlyâ dog. She enjoys playing in a fenced yard and is very fast. She comes when sheâs called and is learning basic commands. Milly is a very gentle, good-natured dog that is anxious to find her forever home. Apply for her today!

Iâm a 7 year old Scottish Terrier (mostly) and when I say terrier, I mean terrier! Iâm playful, cheerful, active, and energetic. My vertical leap is pretty impressive if I say so myself. I came to Releash as an owner surrender when my family moved to a house where Iâm not allowed to live. Itâs a huge bummer, but my foster mom promised my little girl that sheâd find an amazing family to love me. I love to run and play. Just pick up a leash and Iâm ready to roll! Iâm potty trained but Iâm not sure how to ask to go outside. I use a pee-pad in case of emergency. Before coming to Releash, I made some poor potty choices inside but Iâm pretty sure thatâs behind me. My foster mom says Iâm doing great. Iâll come when you call me, and sometimes when you donât - I don't want to miss anything. I love a good chew but I donât want to share it. I could be okay with a smaller furry sibling, but not someone who thinks theyâre the boss. Iâm perfectly happy to be an âonlyâ dog. I like to be outside, but not by myself so I hope weâll go on lots of walks together. And donât worry â if you forget to pay attention to me, Iâll help you! I'll sleep in your lap and I might roll over right there so you can easily rub my tummy. Iâm generous like that. Iâll also be happy to sleep with you â so you donât get lonely. Iâm so excited to come take care of you! Just let me get my leash and toys and Iâll be ready to go!!!!

Sheâs crate trained, potty trained and responds well to positive reinforcement. She does have quite a bit of energy though, so she would be best suited to a household where she has a fenced in back yard to play in, or someone who has a very active lifestyle and can keep this girl entertained.

You know the one with the beagle laying in front of the fire on a plaid dog bed. Well... if you donât mind me also being in your lap part of the time! I am your next family member!!!
Hi! My name is Perry (8 yrs old), and I am in the stage of my life where I am pretty low maintenance! If memory serves me correctly, I have never really been a house dwelling dog. However, I am a quick study and found my favorite places are in someoneâs lap or on the couch. I am crate trained. I am still working on housebreaking when left unattended. 
I have had a rough couple of months with Releash. I had to go through heartworm treatment and then I was not even sure I wanted to live anymore. However, I have decided that love, attention and couches are worth getting up every morning for? I get along with dogs but am very soft natured so would prefer fur buddies with a calm and quiet nature. I live with two cats and they are fine too. I have a beagle voice to announce when something is out of the ordinary but even the deer in the yard donât pay it much attention! So humiliating..

She is relatively low shed but not âhypoallergenicâ.  This pretty girl was rescued the day after she gave birth to 2 puppies (Elsa and Anna) on a county shelter floor and has done a remarkable job as a young momma dog of raising these sweet young puppies.  While she has been in foster care she has proven herself to be a charming houseguest.  She is housebroken and will go to the door when she needs to go out.  She is a little low rider with soulful brown eyes and an infectious smile. She is an awesome couch snuggler and loves laying across her human for belly rubs and head scratches.  Outdoors she is a happy dog.  She literally bounces across her foster momâs backyard chasing birds or balls.  She loves to chew on nylabones and antlers and her forever home will need an assortment of same! She has been âhome schooledâ while weaning her puppies and knows sit, down and stay and is making progress on walking on the leash (please bear in mind she is part dachshund).  She has been sweet with other dogs her size.  She has done well with older children and is expected to be fine with younger kids as well.  (Cats are an unknown at this time, as her foster parents are highly allergic.) Apply today to meet her she will be ready to go to her forever home after March 23rd.

She would be great on an agility course. She loves playing fetch and could chase tennis balls all day long if you let her. She even cleans all of them up when it's time to mow.

Tinker is a sweet little girl who is affectionate but also likes space and slow introductions to people and dogs. So she is seeking a forever home that is calm, quiet and routine. She was returned by her original adoptive family for being nippy when anxious, so she's working with her foster and trainers on social skills and reactivity to changes that might trigger her anxiety.
Tinker comes with FREE TRAINING from Frogs to Dogs, a leading metro Atlanta trainer. They will offer help in transitioning into her new home since change can be hard for introverted-types like her.
But patience will pay off for the adopter who puts their time in with Tinker, as she is easily managed and a super-fun companion.
Age: 4 years
Weight: 40lbs
Vetting: Spayed, up-to-date on vaccinations, heartworm negative
Training: House-trained, crate-trained, walks well on leash and knows tricks.
Temperament: Good with dogs, older respectful kids, can be cat-tested on request

Jazzy's shelter name was Jazz, and the handlers liked the name, so they decided to keep it, but make it just a little â¦ well â¦ jazzier!! So Jazzy it is! Jazzy had been a shelter dog more than once - that's just so sad. She was owned by someone who developed health problems and couldn't care for her, so she was relinquished to the shelter. She was adopted again, and ... not long after that, came back in much worse condition than she left. She was tethered in the second owner's front yard, she had significant hair loss, and was underweight - the note was made that it appeared as though she had not eaten in several days. She was treated for her skin condition, and she gained some weight. She developed an upper respiratory infection and was treated, and she gained some weight. She was spayed and recovered, and gained some weight. All in all, this not-so-little girl gained 23 pounds at the shelter, and is more than slightly rubenesque!! We think she was eating her food, and as much of everyone else's food as she could - poor thing probably just couldn't get past feeling so very hungry!  

  We were drawn to her sunny disposition, so we temperament tested her, and we were thrilled when she passed!! After 185 days in the shelter, she was finally going to get to leave!! This chubby girl (we will work on her weight!!) is a sharpei / pit mix, with a golden brown coat, and smiling face. She does love so very much to give kisses - and we have the pictures to prove it!! She is extremely playful, and loves to engage in toy games with her people.

 Want to help us make sure that the rest of Jazzy's days are full of fun, without any chains or missed meals? Put your application in today - www.caninecellmates.org!

  Jazzy is located in Atlanta, GA and is available for adoption immediately. She will be able to go to her forever home after graduation from the Canine CellMates program. Jazzy is spayed, microchipped and up to date on all her shots. Canine CellMates dogs are trained in items similar to the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. They learn basic obedience and commands such as sit, down, stay, go to place, and leave it. They are also crate trained. If you are interested in adopting Jazzy, please fill out an adoption application at www.caninecellmates.org. or email adopt@caninecellmates.org for more information."

He was a favorite of the staff and volunteers at the shelter but was due to be euthanized due to lack of space. A determined volunteer began reaching out to local rescue groups to save his life and my licensed rescue Hands to Paws in Augusta responded and gave him his freedom ride. Gregor is quite the character and has such a great, playful personality. Heâs currently being boarded at a local kennel an has been there for several months, getting wonderful care there but itâs time for this special boy to have a home of his own!

Heâs affectionate, friendly, loving, loves people and needs to be the only dog in the household. He's good with kids but due to his size and strength it would be best for the kids to be older - no small children. Wonât you consider giving this special boy his permanent soft place to fall? He will bring you so much love and joy. He's got such a great personalty and is a sweet soul. He's had a rough start in life and deserves a loving home. Could it be you? Until his forever home is found we are also looking for a foster home for Gregor - it's a great way to see if he would be a good match for your family and it gives him a chance to be in a home and out of boarding for a while, so please consider fostering sweet Gregor if adopting is not an option right now! There's no cost for fostering - it just requires love and TLC! Please contact me for details about either fostering or adopting this very special soul!

He is learning new things but will benefit from an adopter who is firm & has breed experience. He is good with most dogs but will need proper introduction. He needs to be in a home with no kids or kids older than 13 years old. No cats. He is neutered, microchipped, vaccinated & on preventatives. He is located in Avon, OH. If you have breed experience & are interested in Cogz please apply at www.realrottweilerrescue.com. 

Note: if you have a current dog or cat please make sure vetting is in good standing & animals are fixed & UTD on vaccinations, on preventatives as this is a requirement for potential adopters!

The prospective owner must agree to a screening process that includes an application and the signing of an adoption contract.

Our goal is to find the best match for our dogs and their new families, so that everyone lives happily ever after.

We prefer homes who want to go to an obedience class. Training strengthens the bond and trust that you have with your dog, and it's fun, for both of you! Dogs like to think and to be mentally challenged. The training you do together will be an investment in the future. 

We will try to respond within 24-48 hours, but please be patient as we are volunteer based. We all have full time jobs and are busy with other rescue matters.

Thank you!"

She came to us two years ago from a high capacity shelter in Baltimore where she was found as a stray.  Cali has had a rough life, thatâs for sure. She most likely lived outdoors and Is appreciative of a soft bed. Cali is sometimes aloof and likes to sniff around and do her own thing - probably because she was shut out from her former family. She probably never had medical care. At the age of 14 we had her spayed and had a large mammary tumor removed (benign) and she has settled down to life at our adoption center. We would LOVE for Cali to find a retirement home so that she doesnât have to spend her last years in a kennel. 

Cali would do best as an only dog. She needs someone who will be patient with her as she has probably never lived in a house. She would love a big fenced yard where she can sniff around - her arthritis prevents her from taking walks of any distance more than a stroll to the mailbox. Are you the family that Cali has been waiting for? Please fill out an application at www.companimals.org. Adootion $100."

I'm two years old and super lovable ! I was a stray from the Baltimore County shelter and now have a really nice foster mom with AAHA!

To adopt me, I have few requirements:

*A busy social life- I love to meet people, go on adventures and play with other dogs! My foster mom says I am still working on my leash training skills, but she says I am so much better! It's just that I really do want to play when I see my four legged friends- it's very exciting!

*I am a couch cuddler and bed snuggler!

*I am a great housemate so don't have much I need there- I am crate trained, and now spend time during the day in my foster mom's kitchen on my doggie bed when she works.

*I am not a picky eater, so if you want to train me with yummy treats, I would love that!

Breed: Shepherd/Hound/Lab Mix
Age: 6 years old (As of August 2019)
Good With Dogs: Yes. Dale enjoys playing with and socializing with female dogs and happy, submissive dogs. He is a lady's man.
Good With Cats: Yes
Good With Children: Yes
Heartworm Status: Negative

Dale is a very sweet boy who came from an animal neglect case out of Bibb County. Even though he had a rough start at life, he has a lot of love to give and hasn't let his past define him. He does well with some dogs, and we would say he's selective, but we always require other companions to meet dogs prior to adoption to ensure it is a great match for everyone. He especially loves likes female dogs and submissive dogs that appreciate his status as being his own man.

 He does well with everyone, including small children. He's a very intelligent boy. He thinks he is macho when he is in an environment where he knows what to expect, but with new situations - like the first time he met nail clippers, he turned into a squeaky little mouse in about ten seconds. He gains confidence quickly in new places, and likes to go for walks in his harness. He's stubborn and good natured. Dale is a proud, dapper guy that likes to patrol his grounds, go for walks, and get his back scratched. He is soft like a teddy bear. He is the perfect model who doesn't mind being dressed at all!

Brew is an English Bulldog we saved from a high kill shelter in Tampa. She is 8 years old and in a neglected state. She has a medical history of arthritis spondylosis, she is heartworm positive and required a removal of a blueberry sized mammary node during spay. She is underweight at 35 pounds and will require 3 meals a day. She is quiet,sleeps a lot and the only issue we have seen is some guarding of her xpen area when other dogs nose around. She's fine with other dogs but offers no interactions and turns her head away. Once we have her tuned up she will be available for adoption or long term fostering through heartworm treatment. If you are interested in Brew and have experience with English Bulldogs please contact us. PUPDATE. Brew has been with us for almost a week. She has seen our vet. Her liver values were abnormal and we have had her on supplements and will retest the 2nd week of Sept. She has gotten more energetic,is eating well, and actually is playing with some of the other dogs. She loves people and absolutely loves being pet. She is actually chasing flies! She is becoming a dog again!! Once we do our vet re-check, she will be available for foster to adopt or medical foster. We are a foster-based rescue organization with foster homes throughout the state of Florida.

Riley was surrendered to rescue by a family member after their grandmother passed away.  Unfortunately we don't have much history on Riley as that was not available.  The family was unable to keep Riley due to an upcoming move and knew financially he needed serious dental care.

Riley did have a dental once he came into rescue and had a whopping 20 teeth pulled and he is a much happier dog now!  Before coming into rescue he ate canned food due to his painful mouth.  He now eats kibble but softened with hot water.  

Riley is a sweet gentleman who meshed well with the foster homes Dachshunds, Great Dane and cats.  He LOVES squeaky toys and snoozing in his bed.  Riley does like to take his toys with him when he goes outside to potty.   Riley does have a playful side and will play with the 1 year old Dachshund in his foster home.  

He can be a little protective over his squeaky toys.  

Riley would likely do okay with other dogs or by himself.  He seems to prefer people over the dogs and is a very low key guy.  He loves to sit on your lap and be petted.

Riley has had some accidents in the house, mostly just overnight - some nights he does not have accidents and some he does.  He is crate trained so crating is an option.

Riley is neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm tested negative, on a monthly preventative, microchipped and ready for his new forever family!

If you are interested in adopting Riley, please fill out an adoption application on our website at: http://fldr.org/adopt/adoption-application/. The adoption fee is $150"

Fast forward to April 2019, and he found himself homeless after his mom and dad could no longer care for him.  He spent some time with the nice people at the York Co PA SPCA before he hitched a ride south with a wonderful group of transporters.  

He is about 4 years old, 65 lbs, neutered, and current on vaccines.  His ideal home is a home where he is the only dog, or he has a female dog his size to live with.  He would not do well in a home with cats or small dogs. He loves to ride in a car, but is happy just hanging out at home too.

This is what one of his transporters had to say about him yesterday: \""Tony was just the most sweetest, loving soul!!! And so well trained. He saw a tortoise & a squirrel and was mesmerized and wanted to be \""off to the chasing\""! But the moment I said sit, he turned to face me, sat right down and quietly awaited his next command.

I am available for adoption through Colorado Canine Rescue (CCR), a nonprofit dog rescue located in the Denver area. I came to CCR from Canon City Colorado. There is very little history on me. CCR has been told I am a pit bull breed mix, but that is just a guess made by shelter staff, rescue volunteers, and our veterinarians.

It is said when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Well Kirie has had quite a few lemons handed to her in her 4 year life span, but definitely making the best lemonade that she can. Kirie was adopted out from CCR as a young dog but two years later wound up in the Aurora Shelter, having been abandoned. They called us so we could take her back into our rescue. Kirie has had TPLO surgery since being returned to us, going through training with a behaviorist, and a foster has worked diligently to get her past her pulling on the leash, and help her master her needs to attack water spouts and sprinkler heads.
Kirie still has separation issues, but does well in the foster home left with other dogs and free reign within the home. She is on a generic Prozac to help her manage with anxiety. Kirie loves to snuggle with her people on the couch and in bed and absolutely loves to give kisses. She is looking for a family that will give her plenty of attention, be home more than not, play fetch, take her on walks in the neighborhood. She adores children and is very gentle with them. Kirie so looks forward to rides in the car. She would enjoy being an only dog, but would do fine with a furry companion that has a laissez-faire attitude. She does best if the door is open or a doggie door for her to go out as needed. She needs a more experienced dog owner because she has been through so much in life.

If you are interested in adopting Kirie, please submit an adoption application located on our website, www.coloradocaninerescue.org. We are asking for a $200 adoption donation for Kirie. Kirie being a bully breed, will only be placed in communities that do not have a ban on bullies. Please note, CCR cannot guarantee the breed composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the shelter. 9/15/19 5:01 PM"

She does really well in the crate and is about 90% trustworthy with house training. She does well with other dogs, with an appropriate introduction (her foster brother is a 90 lb pit mix and they are doing well together) but does not like cats at all. So she needs a cat-free home.

In regards to her personality, it took a few days for her to come out of her shell, but now that she has, she wants a *lot* of attention and is fairly high energy. She is also very, very busy and on the go when not in her crate. That being said, she does not bark much for a toy breed. She loves being with people and is really good kids including the 9 and 11 year old in her foster home who are in love with her. She would do well in a home with a lot of stimulation and activity.

The vet believes he is a Catahoula Leopard Dog/Pointer Mix. (The ears are definitely Catahoula!) We think there may be some Staffordshire Bull Terrier or other bully breed in the mix as well.

Perrin is VERY food motivated, which makes him easy to train. The appearance of treats make him laser focused and eager to learn. So far, he's learned \""sit\"" and \""down\"" and he's making great progress learning \""stay\"" and \""base.\"" And this puppy wants snuggles and attention as much as he wants food. He's your basic love sponge. He plays well with every dog he meets, regardless of their age or size. He assumes that all people are going to be utterly charmed by him and want to give him lots of love and attention. So far, he's been right about that.

He loves toys - the fluffier the better. And he's a little kleptomaniac who is obsessed with his foster mom's favorite fuzzy slippers and tries to steal them off her feet at least once a day. Fortunately, he is learning the meaning of the word no and usually responds well to a verbal correction.

Perrin loves to snuggle and cuddle on the couch - he's a great Netflix binge buddy. But he is a very active, energetic puppy who needs lots of exercise and activity to thrive. He would do best in a home that can commit to daily structured exercise - walking or (when he's grown) running, chasing a ball in the yard long enough to tire him out, etc. A tired puppy is a good puppy! His adopters also need to be prepared to continue obedience training (preferably with professional guidance) and provide structure and boundaries necessary to make him a well-adjusted and welcome member of the family. Perrin is going to be a large dog - we're guessing 80 plus pounds of muscle when full grown, so he needs to be well mannered.
Perrin is current on vaccines. He is crate trained and is working hard on house training. The few recent accidents have been due to his foster mom not cluing in fast enough when he tried to let her know he had to go.

This guy is about as perfect as puppies get, so if you're interested in adopting, act quickly. He's not going to be around long!

Only $75 adoption!!!
My adoption profiles tend to be long & very detailed. Please read the ENTIRE Adoption Profile (all the way to the FAQ) so you understand everything about this dog & if you are a good match for her.
Angel had a very very hard start in life. In June she was confiscated from a hoarder, along with multiple other dogs, for living in over crowded deplorable conditions and failure to give medical care.
She was rescued from the Chihuahua hoarder that had over 40 Chihuahuas that I'm sure you saw on the news. Here is one of the videos:
https://www.azfamily.com/news/nearly-chihuahuas-found-abandoned-by-evicted-tenant-in-east-phoenix/article_14325912-8e34-11e9-a4c2-0bdb8b6b9c4f.html?fbclid=IwAR1RI_2n4E6YeTeh7uha9N63VPPwgEiqVjG20HxOw8LElVEahfX5f7G6O24
While at the shelter she was fearful, and that landed her on their euthanasia list.
That is when Safe Haven stepped in. Then when getting her spayed, it was discovered that she had Pyometra (infection in the uterus). So had she not been confiscated, she would have died a slow, painful death...She is all better now, and was given antibiotics to make sure any lingering infection after the surgery is completely gone.
She was scared and shaking when she first got here, but now she is a happy little bundle of joy... She is very sweet and gives kisses and has a happy, peppy playful personality. She wants to be wherever you are & would make a great companion dog. Very loving!

PLEASE NOTE: All of the pets at Safe Haven receive basic training when they come here. All adopters will be given a list of words that your new pet knows at the time of adoption. What each pet learns depends on how much time I have had to work with them, & if that pet has any additional issues that need to be focused on first. The pets here are always improving.
Birthday: 6/9/18

Weight at last Vet visit: 8 lbs and she is at the ideal weight
Cats: Interested in them and will go up and gently sniff them.
Small Dogs: She has been great with all the other small dogs. She will go up and greet them and is very friendly and playful. She would be a great dog park dog!
Large Dogs: She is friendly with large dogs. Even if they get up in her face...
Kids: Unknown, but she is sweet and I imagine she would be great with kids as long as they were gentle with her. Older kids only please since she is so small.

Men: Loving and affectionate.

Women: Loving and affectionate
Strangers: Loving and affectionate. Especially if they have treats!
Food: I feed all the dogs on a rotational diet. Which means they get a different brand of high quality food each month. I do this because I do not think that one brand can provide all the nutrients that they need. Just like one food can't provide us with all that we need...Plus, who wants to eat the same thing every day? All dogs are fed breakfast (6 am) & dinner (5 pm), & are fed in their crate with their own bowl.   She gets 1/4 cup for breakfast and again for dinner for a total of 1/2 cup of dry food a day.  Plus for dinner, I add 1 tsp. organic coconut oil,  & some type of extra goody like canned food, cottage cheese, organic pureed pumpkin, or an organic veggie. She's a great eater & has eaten everything I have given her. She is so funny. It takes me awhile to get the meals together for all the dogs, and she will stand up on her hind legs while waiting in anticipation! To funny!
Crate Trained: Yes, She has not had an accident in a long time. She now goes in on her own (she will follow the food) She is let out multiple times throughout the day, and can hold it through the night.
She is in a small 24\"" x 18\"" wire crate.
House Trained: In training. She seems to understand that her business needs to be done outside.
I do have to make sure she goes outside though, because she doesn't want to leave me to go out on her own. She is more willing to go outside without me if another dog goes out with her...
She also had submissive urination whenever I would walk towards her when she first came here. That is what happens when dogs are really scared. Much like when a humane says \""I was so scared I peed my pants!\"". I have found that if I talk to her in a baby voice when I am walking up to her, it calms her down and it doesn't happen. Only time she does it now is in the morning when she has a full bladder.
Leash Trained: The leash is new to her, and she is apprehensive about it. Treats help coax her to walk on leash...
Car: She rides in a carrier
Other issues: - Tips of ears are missing.
Adoption fee is only $75 & includes:
- Spay/Neuter surgery

ADOPTING A CAT OR DOG IS UP TO A 20 YEAR COMMITMENT! THEY ARE NOT OBJECTS THAT YOU CAN GET RID OF WHEN THEY BECOME INCONVENIENT. THEY ARE INNOCENT LIVING, BREATHING ANIMALS WITH FEELINGS THAT DEPEND ON YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO TAKE CARE OF, LOVE, & PAY FOR EVERYTHING THIS PET NEEDS FOR UP TO 20 YEARS, THEN PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR AN APPLICATION.
* Safe Haven STRONGLY believes that collars should only be used as decoration or to hold the ID tag. If you are trying to restrain your dog, it can easily slip out of a collar. Also, attaching a leash to a collar puts pressure on the neck, which is one of the most sensitive areas of the body, & could hurt them. For these reasons, Safe Haven includes a harness with every dog adoption to ensure the safety of the dog. A harness distributes the weight on the chest & shoulders. It also has a handle on the back that you can grab if need be, without hurting your pet (EX: Dog falls off your boat, just grab the handle & pull your pet back in with no harm done. With a collar, you would have to strangle your dog when pulling your dog in). Also, it is very hard for a dog to slip out of a harness when properly fitted. So it is much easier to restrain them.
FAQ:
Q: Is this pet still available?
A: Status of each pet is  posted in the original post on the Facebook page for Safe Haven Animal Rescue of AZ at https://www.facebook.com/groups/1405138936478168/  . It will say the status in ALL CAPS at the very top of the pets post, and updates are posted in the comment section of each pets post.  
 Once on the Facebook page, type the pets name in the search box in the upper right corner to easily pull up all the posts on that pet.
Q: Why are your adoption fees so low?
A: Safe Haven does things very differently than other rescues do. If you look at our other pets up for adoption, and also our past adoptions, you'll see that ALL our prices are low. We do this because it generates a lot of interest, and gets the pets adopted quickly. The more that get adopted, the more we can rescue. We only deal with pets in danger of being euthanized. The whole point is to save as many lives as possible! We are all about the animals here. And if you want to add a donation to the adoption price to show appreciation for all the hard work we do, then please indicate that in your application!
Q: I don't see a phone #. Will someone please call me?
A: Everything needed is online. I have found that online is the most efficient way to get all the work done. In the past, when I posted my #, my phone rang off the hook all day. So I spent the whole day on the phone, with not much work to show for it at the end of the day. Again, everything needed is online.
Q: How do I adopt this pet?
A: Your first step is to fill out an application. http://www.adoptapet.com/Safe-Haven/adoption-application/
Q: Can I adopt if I live out of state?

She's a pointer mix or lab/cattle dog mix- we don't know for sure. She was surrendered to a vet office by her family because she was in need of surgery for her eyes - she had entropian which means the eyelids/lashes turn in and irritate the eyes and cause infection. She also was covered in ticks - obviously not well cared for. She had the surgery before she came to us and her eyes got infected - we have treated her for that and will update pictures soon! Scarlet weighs 36 pounds and is super sweet and submissive. Scarlet is ready to find her new family!

Sheâs estimated to be 7-8 years old. She was found as a stray out in the country dragging her hind legs behind her due to some injury or impairment. She has some apparent muscle wasting in her hind end and sores on her legs from dragging herself around. We had it checked out and the xrays showed no significant findings as far as arthritis or fractures (but she does have a bullet in her lumbar area but not believed to be causing any issues at this point) but she had some pain in her back so she was started on gabapentin to try to help. But donât let Miss Flo Jo fool you â she can climb baby gates and get around just fine! We donât know her history but we know her future looks wonderful â full of love and comfy beds and healthy food and no more worries about being shot at. She sometimes seems to poop when she doesn't know she's doing it like when she's super excited. The vet said it's possible there was a little nerve damage back there that occurred when the other injuries occurred. She can be a little nervous sometimes so we think a home without small children is what she needs.

And sheâs such a nice dog too! She weighs almost 20 pounds and is long and low to the ground - some kind of spaniel mix. Sheâs estimated to be 7 years old. We have no idea on her background - she came into the shelter as a stray with lots of mammary tumors. The shelter spayed her and took off the first set of tumors before we got her (and unfortunately did not send them out for testing) and then we had the remaining tumors removed - both benign- YAY! While we have no history on her, we can tell she had a family at some point â this girl is very well behaved, she knows the commands sit, down, and sit pretty! She often chooses to go in a crate even though she doesnât have to, and she loves going for rides in the car! She has had two potty accidents in the 3 weeks that we have had her and that was on a potty pad. She gets along fine with other dogs and has met the cats in her foster home and was fine with them as well. WE LEARNED THAT GOLDIE IS NOT GOOD WITH KIDS. We found that Petsmart was not really where she showed her best self- she barked at a lot of the dogs while on leash and barked in her crate and she did try to nip a child's hand - that's why we say NO KIDS. She's wonderful at her foster home with adults and has done well at the vet meeting new people - she gives a little side eye like she's unsure but warms up nicely.

She's also hard of hearing - it's rough being an old gal! She circles a lot in the house and yard as she wanders. She's not the most engaging doggy at first - it takes her a while to warm up and show happiness through tail wags and greetings. Sheâs estimated at 10-12+ years old and is about 15 pounds. She was extremely matted when she came into the shelter so she had to get shaved down. She had a dental with several extractions - she does not have a lot of teeth left but she still eats just fine!

Probably because she had a very large hernia as well as a second hernia and needed medical care ASAP. We got her the care she needed - her intestines were in those hernias! Thankfully she did well in surgery and recovered well. Our vet thought her heart looked enlarged on X-ray but she saw a cardiologist and had an echocardiogram and they said her heart is shaped normally, not enlarged, and that other than having very mild valve disease (common for her breed) sheâs in great shape â no medicine, no restrictions! But she's fun, happy, playful and super excited about life! She loves to ride in the car- she explores everywhere and looks out the windows to flirt with other drivers! She is food protective - she will guard it from people and other dogs (she barks & growls at the other dogs to keep them away and blocks them) so she may need to be fed separately if her forever home has other dogs and a home without small children would be best for her. She is estimated to be about 8-9 years old (shelter originally guessed around 5 but our vet thinks she's older than that). She weighs 7 pounds. She is not completely housetrained. She has a potty pad in her area where she eats and sleeps and has used it occasionally (less as time goes by) and when she comes out of her area and runs to the door, if you're not quick enough or if she gets distracted and runs away from the door, she sometimes squats to potty before you can get her outside.

My name is Jimmy. I am a 5 year old male Chihuahua/Jack Russell Terrier and I weigh 12 pounds, although I could lose a pound or two. My story is a little long but it goes like this, my first known family left me in a house. The people that moved in decided to keep me since I was already there. Somehow I ended up at the shelter shortly after in 2016. I was adopted out, but returned 3 years later to the same shelter because my owners were getting a divorce. That's when LuvFurMutts got me out of the shelter. I am the sweetest boy and I love everybody, although I can be a bit scared at first. I love to be pet and I love treats! I do great with other dogs and I don't pay attention to cats. I would do best in a home with kids 8 and up. I would love to find a forever family that will really be my FOREVER family! Can you open your heart up to me?

We got her a cart that she is learning to use to help her stay upright and hopefully build some muscle mass. Her body may not be the best anymore, but her spirit and enjoyment of life is still there and we think she can bring some joy to someone's life. Lucy is super sweet. She's not housetrained. Because she isn't able to get up on her own, she often will poop under herself when in her dog bed. Thankfully she has nice solid poop so it's not a mess! You have to sprint to get her outside to potty or she will pee like a fountain while you are carrying her - a towel over her and a sprint is a good tip!

Diane needs a patient mom and/or dad (adult only home) who will give her the time and space she needs to feel comfortable and loved. She does best with a single person but can learn to love others with time, patience, and treats, but with visitors, she may need to be put in another room - she barks and may nip. Sheâs a 4-6 year old chihuahua mix who was found in a vacant apartment. Once sheâs settled in, sheâs very sweet and loving. It just takes time and it will take someone who can see beyond her scared exterior.

He needs to be in a home with no other alpha male dogs. He does fine with small male dogs. He is very attached and loves to be with you. He is extremely found of kids. Kids seem to be his favorite thing. Just wants to be with them. He is fine with cats. He will jump a fence shorter than 8 ft. So will need a tie out, electric fence or leashed to go out. He is very well trained on the electric fence. He is completely potty-trained. He loves to sleep in bed with you on your head. He is a calm dog and loves to relax on a couch or chair. He does get spurts of energy where he wants to play as he is still puppy. For the most part he is a relaxed, calm dog. Can you open your home and heart to Atlas?

Bailey is about 4-5 years old and he is a Yorkie mix â he is on the bigger side around 20 pounds or so. Heâs a healthy guy and he loves to play ball and be near his people but he does not need to be in your lap â just knowing youâre close by is good for him. 

Unfortunately Bailey has some quirks that make him need to be pretty selective in who his forever family will be. Bailey does not like kids â at all. Bailey does not like to meet other dogs when heâs on a leash so walks are not much fun.  Bailey does not particularly like to share special space (like his favorite personâs bed) but he does OK once you let him know the rules. He might snap if another dog steps on him or gets in his space but he usually can figure it out. He had an issue when the grown daughter in his foster family tried to get on the mom's bed where Bailey was and nipped at her so that's another thing to consider.  Bailey really needs a privacy fenced backyard (or no neighbors) so heâs not distracted by neighbors (big/little humans or dogs) who will get him all riled up. And heâs very sensitive to sights and sounds around him that make him nervous and he will bark, so no apartment or condo type situation for him. He had an incident where some noise or movement triggered him and he nipped the leg of a person who was doing nothing other than having a conversation with his foster mom - they couldn't figure out what might have triggered him and Bailey has worked with a trainer who also couldn't identify a trigger or replicate that kind of reaction,. but as a result we know that Bailey doesn't do well in many normal social situations. He takes Prozac for his anxiety but he still can be a little unpredictable as far as his reaction in certain situations. He's wonderful in his foster home  - loving, funny, smart, well-behaved, rarely has a potty accident. But he doesn't handle visitors well and needs to be restrained or put in another room and slow introductions done. He gets super excited when the leash comes out and loves car rides.  Bailey is complicated. We know that. We still think his person is out there!

That probably makes it sound like Bailey is just awful and heâs not at all! We just know that everyone gets sucked in by his good looks, and we want to make it very clear that unfortunately Bailey is not going to be a match for most people. But for the right person or family, Bailey will be a wonderful companion and friend! Heâs well behaved in the house, he gets along with the other dogs and cats in his foster home, he sits politely to wait for treats, and he loves to dance!  He does pull on the leash â heâs in a big hurry to get wherever heâs going! Petsmart is really not where he shines because the dogs are on leashes and heâs in a crate - at adoption events with dogs parading past and people staring at him, itâs not his scene. He gets overly stressed and acts out.

Bailey is looking for his perfect home â we know itâs a tall order but we also know itâs out there! We have learned a lot about Bailey in the last couple of months which helped us be able to narrow down the list of what works for him so that we can hopefully make a successful match. If you think you might be the right match for Bailey, please go to our website to submit an adoption application www.recycleddoggies.org THAT IS THE FIRST STEP IN OUR PROCESS. Please do not just show up at an adoption event and expect to adopt a dog that day - we need time to review your application ahead of time, which is why we ask that you submit your application ahead of time so you don't miss out on the dog you are hoping to adopt while you wait for your application to be reviewed.

We estimate him to be 10+ years old. He came into the shelter already neutered and missing an eye - we don't know his history so we don't know how he lost his eye or where his family went. He was a stray. He weighs 12 pounds. He has some compression in his spine and takes anti-inflammatories and glucosamine for that and it helps him walk more easily and comfortably. He's very sweet and just wants to be loved. He does have a cataract in his remaining eye but seems to see some.  He's an old guy with old guy issues but he still deserves to be loved!

No cats or kids for Sugar. She appears to have been mistreated in the past and while she needs training and structure, that needs to be done in a gentle style.

I am on medication, but it is less than $10 a month to refill. Despite a heart murmur, I can still live a long, happy life as it is being take care of. I cough sometimes due to a slight bend in my trachea which will improve as I lose weight. I am house trained and crate trained! However, I am not destructive so there isn't truly a need to crate me. I would do best with someone who is home a lot. I like being with humans! I am a quiet guy that gets along with other dogs, as long as they are small. Big dogs are scary. I am fine with cats and I like kids too! My foster mom says I'm the sweetest, cutest little old man ever. I love going on walks! I just need a quiet home to settle down and be loved on forever.

Sassy found herself with LFM after her owner passed away. Her sister was adopted very quickly after coming to LFM, so Sassy doesn't understand why she hasn't been adopted yet. She was very well taken care of and had Dentals every two years. Sassy is extremely well potty trained. She will go to the door and let you know when she has to go out. Sassy does fine with other small dogs, as long as they are not in her face. Sassy would need a home without cats as she likes to chase them. She loves the yard and going outside including running. She needs a home without small kids since she is a little older herself. She would be okay around kids if grandchildren visit as long as they understand she doesn't like to play. Sassy has a pin in her neck, but we do not know why. She also sometimes favors a leg. The vet said it is no problem and her leg is in no pain. Sassy loves to snuggle and will sit in your lap as often as you let her and is also happy curled up on the couch in her blanket as well. She sleeps through the night. She is a very sweet and loving devoted little girl. Can you open your heart up to Sassy?

I am a 7-8 year old male Chihuahua that weighs 11 pounds. I came to LFM after Animal Control was called to take me when a man was arrested and had me in his truck so I ended up at a shelter. I love neck scratches and snuggling/burrowing in blankets on the couch. I can be nervous at first so I need time to warm up. For that reason, I need a home with kids 12 and up. I do great in the car and on my leash, and I'm crate trained and potty trained. I am okay with other dogs my size, big dogs scare me. I ignore them as long as they leave me alone, but I would prefer to be the only dog. I need a home with no acts because I like to chase them. I just need a quiet home with someone who understands that I had a rough start to my life. I want someone to love me just the way I am. I am a really good boy and want to live my life with someone who is patient and kind. Can you open your heart up to me?

So she made the trip from Cincinnati to Youngstown where she slid into foster home easily.

This girl weighs about 7 1/2 pounds and is fully vetted. She just had a dental so she's much more pleasant to be around. :)  We're really just learning about her.

She's learning to be her foster mom's \""chair Chi\"" and is finding her place in the pack. She's a bit nervous and reserved at first, but once she's used to her situation she is a very friendly, sweet girl. She's good with other small dogs and so-so with cats. She would probably prefer a home without a cat, but once properly introduced to one, she should be OK. 

She is crate trained, but during feeding times is very vocal. During that time, she sounds like a wild animal or bird from a jungle. Right before and after feeding you wouldn't think she was a Chihuahua. Other than that, she's pretty good in a crate.

We're working on house training. She will potty outside, but her potty breaks need to be consistent. She loves her basket and blanket, and loves sleeping (like all seniors do!)

Callie would like a quieter household with her own personal human to love and bond with. She's a good little guard Chi who wants a home that she can protect when called upon. She wants regular feeding (and peanut butter snacks!!!) and chair time so she can feel close to her person.

**Callie is being fostered in Youngstown, OH**

Callie's adoption fee is $250. If she sounds like the dog of your dreams please contact Chihuahua Rescue & Transport and she will pack her toys and love and be there in a wag of her tail.

If you would like more information about adopting this dog, please go to our website(www.chihuahua-rescue.org). All dogs listed are adoptable in the 10 Midwestern states(OH/IN/KY/IL/MN/MI/WI/PA/IA/MO). We do transport! All of our dogs are spread out throughout the Midwest in foster homes.

Tillie is a tiny little (6 pound) Yorkie, Broken Coated Jack Russell, Maltese mix. She came to use from a hoarding situation where she was confined in a basement without much human contact. She has blossomed in rescue.

Tillie is house trained, crate trained, does well on a leash and enjoys riding in a car, sleeping in bed. Our little Ragamuffin is very sweet and attached to her foster providers but still timid with people she does not know.  She does warm up but will need a quiet, calm home full of TLC and an understanding of her past. She will continue to heal as she settles into her forever life and experiences more fun doggie things to do.

Tillie's adoption will require a securely fenced yard or fenced area that leads directly into the home.  She will need someone that is not working away from home a typical 8 hour work day; someone that works from home and can have their dog in their work space, someone who works VERY part time of is retired.  Tillie will need another very socialized dog, non alpha dog, in the home that she can emulate which will help her to adjust.  Tillie will blossom with an owner who is calm and kind, that will take her out and about and continue to offer her positive experiences. Adopters must live within a 1.5 hour drive from Wooster OH which includes The Cleveland and Columbus areas.

Star-Mar Rescue is a natural care provider and we place our dogs in homes that are already on a natural care program or are eager to learn. We use no chemicals on our dogs, no commercial flea products (oral or topical), do blood titers instead of randomly vaccinating. Our yards are without fertilizer and weed killer and our homes are toxin free. We feel that dogs can be protected without being harmed by harsh chemicals and unnecessary vaccinations and do best on a species appropriate, no grain, raw diet. Frozen raw diets, freeze dried or dehydrated no grain. Raw, no grain foods are easily gotten at many pet stores and on line and are no more expensive than a high quality dry food. This simple step will provide your dog the nutrition needed to keep them healthy and happy for many years unlike feeding a lifetime of processed foods. We are happy to help with this transition. For more information go to Star-Mar Rescue Natural Care facebook page and click on \""videos\"" in the column to the left and watch the 7 part series called The Truth About Pet Cancer. It will give you an understanding of what we are doing and why. Please do some research on natural care and raw feeding and decide whether or not you can care for Tillie in this manner before requesting an application.

If you feel that your lifestyle and environment meet with Tillie's needs, please directly contact Martha at learymjri@aol.com or call 330-466-3667 or 330-262-0515 for an application or more information. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE LINK PROVIDED BY PETFINDER AS IT IS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE.  Tillie's adoption will require an approved application and a home visit, with adoption completed at her foster home in Wooster, OH. Tillie's adoption fee is $300. We will work to place her within a 1.5 hour driving distance from her foster home in Wooster, OH. so that we can conduct a home visit bringing Tillie with us. This area includes the Columbus, Cleveland area of OH.

x- pen with a number of other dogs. He was not socialized. He was afraid of everything and afraid to be handled but he knew he wanted out.  When I went to assess the situation Sly stood on his back feet at the x-pen.  He would run and hide when I got close but finally he let me pick him up and I took him home that night.  I came back several days later and took 14 more dogs.  

WELL.... Mr. Sly has come along way from the basement and he is one SUPER little guy!  He is a major love bug, is learning to play ball and loves going for walks.  He loves other dogs and really loves kitties.  He is playful with dogs his size.  Sly is with you every minute, comes when he called, VERY crate trained, is house trained and adores his people.

Sly might be shy when he first moves.  His foster home is all that he has ever know but he will quickly bond with his new family.  He wants to please and be loved.  He is a bit standoffish with men at first but warms up quickly.  He will need a quiet and calm home that ONLY uses positive reinforcement training.  He is house trained in his foster home but could possibly need some guidance when he transfers.  

Sly would not be a good candidate for children. Not because of any aggression but he does not know how to respond to them and would not be a fun dog for kids to have. He needs adults to continue to offer him good experiences that will build his confidence. 

Sly's adoption requirements are a fenced yard or fenced area large enough for him to run and play that leads directly into the home.  A person who does not work a typical 8 hour work day; someone who works from home and can have a dog in their work space, works very part time or is retired but active.  He will need another well socialized, calm, non alpha type dog in the home as he has never in his life been without other dogs and will emulate a well socialized, friendly, happy dog.  He will blossom with an owner who is calm and kind, that will take him out and about and continue to offer positive experiences to this sweet boy. Adopters must live within a 1.5 hour drive from Wooster OH which includes The Cleveland and Columbus areas.  

Star-Mar Rescue is a natural care provider and we place our dogs in homes that are already on a natural care program or are eager to learn. We use no chemicals on our dogs, no commercial flea products (oral or topical), do blood titers instead of randomly vaccinating. Our yards are without fertilizer and weed killer and our homes are toxin free. We feel that dogs can be protected without being harmed by harsh chemicals and unnecessary vaccinations and do best on a species appropriate, no grain, raw diet. Frozen raw diets, freeze dried or dehydrated no grain. Raw, no grain foods are easily gotten at many pet stores and on line and are no more expensive than a high quality dry food. This simple step will provide your dog the nutrition needed to keep them healthy and happy for many years unlike feeding a lifetime of processed foods. We are happy to help with this transition. For more information go to Star-Mar Rescue Natural Care facebook page and click on \""videos\"" in the column to the left and watch the 7 part series called The Truth About Pet Cancer. It will give you an understanding of what we are doing and why. Please do some research on natural care and raw feeding and decide whether or not you are wanting to care for Sly in this manner before requesting an application.

If you feel that your lifestyle and environment meet with Sly's needs, please directly contact Martha at learymjri@aol.com or call 330-466-3667 or 330-262-0515 for an application or more information. PLEASE DO NOT USE THE LINK PROVIDED AS IT IS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE. Sly's adoption will require an approved application and a home visit, with adoption completed at his foster home in Wooster, OH. Sly's adoption fee is $275. We will work to place him within a 1.5 hour driving distance from his foster home in Wooster, OH. so that we can conduct a home visit bringing Sly with us. This area includes the Columbus, Cleveland area of OH.

Riley was surrendered to rescue by a family member after their grandmother passed away.  Unfortunately we don't have much history on Riley as that was not available.  The family was unable to keep Riley due to an upcoming move and knew financially he needed serious dental care.

Riley did have a dental once he came into rescue and had a whopping 20 teeth pulled and he is a much happier dog now!  Before coming into rescue he ate canned food due to his painful mouth.  He now eats kibble but softened with hot water.  

Riley is a sweet gentleman who meshed well with the foster homes Dachshunds, Great Dane and cats.  He LOVES squeaky toys and snoozing in his bed.  Riley does like to take his toys with him when he goes outside to potty.   Riley does have a playful side and will play with the 1 year old Dachshund in his foster home.  

He can be a little protective over his squeaky toys.  

Riley would likely do okay with other dogs or by himself.  He seems to prefer people over the dogs and is a very low key guy.  He loves to sit on your lap and be petted.

Riley has had some accidents in the house, mostly just overnight - some nights he does not have accidents and some he does.  He is crate trained so crating is an option.

Riley is neutered, up to date on vaccines, heartworm tested negative, on a monthly preventative, microchipped and ready for his new forever family!

If you are interested in adopting Riley, please fill out an adoption application on our website at: http://fldr.org/adopt/adoption-application/. The adoption fee is $150"

She spent her first six years in a puppy mill. When the mill was closed down by the state, she went to an out of state shelter. They had so many Minis, that they asked for help from some breed rescue groups, and Coco came to Colorado. She was adopted to a wonderful couple, but after three years, and two babies, Coco was no longer comfortable and they asked us to take her back. She is still timid, but comfortable enough to sleep with her foster mom, and she is getting along well with the dogs in her foster home. She loves attention and she would make a great lap companion while you are reading or watching TV.  Coco would do best in an experienced \""mill dog\"" home, and she would, of course, love a home with a retired owner or someone who works from home.

Coco is spayed, she is up to date on her vaccinations (rabies, distemper and kennel cough), vet checked, heartworm tested negative and on preventative while in rescue, and microchipped.  Coco had surgery to repair a luxating patella while she has been back with us.  She is nearly fully recovered from that but should not be doing a lot of up and down motion. If you would like to meet Coco, go to www.cominischnauzerrescue.com and complete the on-line adoption application.

I am available for adoption through Colorado Canine Rescue (CCR), a nonprofit dog rescue located in the Denver area. I came to CCR from Canon City Colorado. There is very little history on me. CCR has been told I am a pit bull breed mix, but that is just a guess made by shelter staff, rescue volunteers, and our veterinarians.

It is said when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Well Kirie has had quite a few lemons handed to her in her 4 year life span, but definitely making the best lemonade that she can. Kirie was adopted out from CCR as a young dog but two years later wound up in the Aurora Shelter, having been abandoned. They called us so we could take her back into our rescue. Kirie has had TPLO surgery since being returned to us, going through training with a behaviorist, and a foster has worked diligently to get her past her pulling on the leash, and help her master her needs to attack water spouts and sprinkler heads.
Kirie still has separation issues, but does well in the foster home left with other dogs and free reign within the home. She is on a generic Prozac to help her manage with anxiety. Kirie loves to snuggle with her people on the couch and in bed and absolutely loves to give kisses. She is looking for a family that will give her plenty of attention, be home more than not, play fetch, take her on walks in the neighborhood. She adores children and is very gentle with them. Kirie so looks forward to rides in the car. She would enjoy being an only dog, but would do fine with a furry companion that has a laissez-faire attitude. She does best if the door is open or a doggie door for her to go out as needed. She needs a more experienced dog owner because she has been through so much in life.

If you are interested in adopting Kirie, please submit an adoption application located on our website, www.coloradocaninerescue.org. We are asking for a $200 adoption donation for Kirie. Kirie being a bully breed, will only be placed in communities that do not have a ban on bullies. Please note, CCR cannot guarantee the breed composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the shelter. 9/15/19 5:01 PM"

He does not get along well with my dog but she instigates most of the arguments. He has a prey drive - wants to chase cats, but unsure if he would harm them. Growls slightly when you try to get him to do things he doesn't want to do (such as a bath). Trainer evaluation (Janet at SkyviewK9, TROY, OH) said that he would benefit immensely from training and would be a perfect dog. (If adopted, DREAM pet rescue - Dream4pets.org - will assist with the training expenses.)

? Favorite toy: Kong, ball and leash
? Enjoys: car rides, walks, playing ball, chew toys
? Favorite activity: Cuddling or playing

******IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ ALL THE GREAT INFO BELOW******

PLEASE read our website's ADOPTION PROCESS PAGE prior to submitting an adoption application. www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-process 
ADOPTION APPLICATION: www.apupspizzazzrescue.com/adoption-application 

ABOUT OUR RESCUE DOGS: 
All of our sweet fur babies are being socialized daily with other dogs, adults, & most importantly, children. They are ALL in homes being cared for by people who LOVE them! All of our dogs are located in Connecticut, are spayed or neutered, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, dewormed, have had CT State health checks, & go home with a leash, collar, & packet of medical paperwork. 

BREED IDENTIFICATION:
Please understand that many rescue dogs are mixes of multiple breeds. Petfinder allows us to choose up to two breeds per dog. While the shelters and our rescue do our best in accurately identifying breeds, breed identification is not guaranteed. If there is a certain breed that you do not want, it is very important that you share this with our rescue when applying. When adopting a puppy, breed uncertainty plays a big part in the size/look of the dog as an adult. Please know that any puppy can be a wonderful dog, regardless of preconceived notions of certain breeds, but it is very important that the adopter has the dedication and patience to raise the puppy with boundaries, consistency, structure, & love. The more effort you give towards training & time you allow for exercise, your puppy will grow to be a HUGE source of UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, TOTAL LOYALTY, HAPPINESS, COMFORT & COMPANIONSHIP!

ABOUT OUR RESCUE:
We are a small rescue run by volunteers & focused on finding the right match for both our dogs & for you. If you are interested in adopting through our rescue, you first will need to complete an adoption application & be approved as a potential adopter before meeting any of our pups. No need to be intimidated by our application as it allows us to get to know you & your lifestyle. Of course, the more you can share the better! Please also note, while a fenced yard is fantastic, it is not required by our rescue, however, it may be required for a certain dog.

Stormy, is in need of a home! He is a great guy that will be a wonderful companion and friend! 

Stormy is WONDERFUL! He is generally peaceful and quiet. He is social, loves people, and is good with other dogs.

This guy is not only beautiful to look at, but he's funny too! Just watching him, will bring a smile to your face!

So good on the leash, his foster families' 11 year old daughter can walk him out in public, with no problem whatsoever!

Stormy ADORES hanging out outside, and watching the world go by. So, in order to safely have him relax outside for the amount of time that he would love, we are requiring his adopters to have a fully enclosed yard, with a physical fence, or at the very least, go to an adopter that like to spend A LOT of time outside!

***At this time, we are looking for an experienced handler for the Big Guy. Additionally, a home with no young children.

She is 8 years old in good health and weighs 9 lbs. She has been with her current owners since she was a puppy but because of health issues they are no longer able to care for her.  

Molly can be shy and fearful so an ideal home would be with a patient family.  She has lived with cats and dogs but would benefit from more experiences outside the home to build her confidence and help her enjoy our beautiful world.
When Molly does bond with her people she enjoys being with them and is definitely a lap dog!

Because Molly is low energy and doesnât need lots of exercise she would do well in a stand alone home, apartment or condo.
If you could give Molly a new lease on life she would love to meet you. Please call 860-242-9999 or e-mail annmarie@ourcompanions.org.

For the last 2 months Sheba has been living with a wonderful senior woman who has grown very attached to her but her size is just not the right fit to make this her permanent home. Sheba is a very shy and timid dog who will require an owner willing to accept that she likes to hang out under the coffee table or behind the couch and does things in her own time. Once you have gained her trust she will welcome affection and spend more time close to her person. She walks well on leash but does get anxious when she sees other people and dogs on her walks. Patience and training will be necessary as well as the strength and agility to hold on to her if she tries to pull away or reacts abruptly to something that may frighten her. We think Sheba was probably an outdoor dog. We are looking for a home that has a physical fence for her to be able to run and play and a quiet atmosphere. No toddlers or young kids but possibly older kids/teens who are not expecting a playmate. Sheba has not been overly interested in other dogs at her prior foster homes.

We do adoption events every few months but primarily work one-on-one with each applicant to match the right dog to the right family. Once your application is received, all questions can be answered. We currently adopt to homes along the East Coast of the United States.  The adoption fee ranges from $250-$525 depending on age of the dog and transport distance/cost.

Please go to our website at www.littleblackdogrescue.org to see more information and to fill out our online application. Applications are required before conversations about potential matches can begin. Please check our website for up to date availability.

 We are a non profit organization and the adoption fee goes towards the transport, vetting, spay/neuter and boarding needs of the dogs we rescue. LBDR is a small rescue that receives a minor discount on vetting unlike larger rescues who self-administer or receive volume discounts. LBDR focuses on the rescue, care and placement of black dogs who are in danger of euthanasia due to their color, as well as other dogs who are in immediate need. LBDR is funded by donations which are used solely for the 
care of our dogs."

ONYA is a Great Pyrenees mix female dog.  She is also a large girl for a 9-month old dog, but that goes with her breed mix.  She weighed 87 lbs. at intake and is a lovely-to-look-at long-haired girl.  Her coloring is white/brown/black.  Maybe she likes Beethoven?!  You can see her now during normal business hours at the county animal shelter in their adoption facility.  Remember: that building is at the top left side once you go through the front gates of the shelter and reach the top of the driveway.

Adoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50.
The shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family. 

Hold periods for every incoming animal vary for several reasons including, but not limited to, whether the animal came in from the Cumberland County area, or from the City of Crossville, which contracts with the county for its animal shelter services.  Check with the staff to verify the availability date of every animal for which you have an interest.

For more information on this pet, call the shelter at (931)484-8525. The shelter is open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 10am to 2pm. Closed Wednesday and Sunday and county observed holidays."

Large and lovely is CANNOLI, a black female adult Lab mix dog.  She weighed 80 lbs, at intake and is a beautiful black color.  See this lady during the shelterâs normal business hours.  NOTE: like too many dogs that get adopted through the shelter, CANNOLI has been found to be heartworm positive.  That means her previous adoption could not go and she cannot be adopted to the public until she is treated - which has to take place before she can be spayed.  This will take time.  Talk with shelter staff about the length of time treatment will require before she can move forward in the adoption process.  She is located in their adoption facility at the top and left of the driveway after you pass through the gates. The boy in the photos with her is Charlie, an older male Lab with whom she is housed.

MORGAN FREEMAN is a newly neutered, 2-3 year-old male Blue Heeler mix dog.  He is blue/white/black and weighed 40 lbs. at intake.  Staff says he is sweet himself, but a little bossy with other dogs. He might get along better with a female dog if you have one at home.  At the shelter he was initially housed with a submissive male dog and he picked on that one.  Thanks to H.A.R.T., a local rescue group, MORGAN FREEMAN was sponsored through his neuter surgery and rabies vaccine.  He is ready to go home immediately upon adoption.  The neuter surgery itself may result in a more relaxed dog when he is around other animals, as well!  Something to think about if you have other animals at home that still have not been spayed/neutered.

Adoption fees are $80 for dogs.  Cat adoption fees are $50.
The shelter routinely vaccinates all healthy appearing animals upon their arrival at the shelter and deworms them.  Any animals not already spayed/neutered must have the procedure done through the veterinary clinic that contracts with the county before that animal can be released from the clinic to the new family. By state law, animals old enough to be given a rabies vaccine, must have that vaccine done, as well.  The vaccine is given by the veterinary clinic staff at a separate cost to the adoptive family.

Meet Rosie! She's the most chill pup you will meet! She is calm, affectionate, and loves to snuggle. This girl is the sweetest and she is so grateful to be in a rescue searching for her forever home. 

Rosie is one of the few \""bully\"" mixes in the Prince George's County Shelter to leave alive. This is due to a ban on bully breeds in the county that prevents adoption of these dogs to the general public. The only bully dogs that leave the shelter alive are released to approved rescues.

The shelter has a group of dedicated staff and volunteers who evaluate and work with these dogs to identify the most highly adoptable ones and pitch them to DC rescues, pleading for their help in saving them. This group lobbied hard for Rosie to be rescued, and DC PAWS is fortunate to have had a willing foster who allowed us to rescue this very deserving gal.

Upon meeting Rosie, it was very clear why she was a staff favorite. She is so gentle and lovely. She gets along well with other dogs and even cats! She is a total couch potato and would make a great fit for an adopter who loves to binge watch Netflix. She would love a calm home where she can be spoiled!

Like most shelter dogs, Rosie may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.

The adoption fee for this dog is $350. If you are interested in adopting Rosie, please submit an adoption application at https://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/adoption-application-dogs/DC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals. Please note that we cannot make any guarantees about age or breed; we rely upon our rescue partners and their veterinarians to make those assessments.

Meet Betty! Betty is a sweetheart in need of a loving home. Betty has a lot of great attributes - she loves to play, seeks out affection and attention, and is a quick learner. Betty is also very sensitive and has shown a hesitancy towards men. She is also slightly reactive towards dogs while on a leash. Betty will need a very patient, experienced dog owner to help her come out of her shell and become the best dog she can be. She will do best in a low traffic, calm home. She would also benefit from working with a behavioral consultant to help manage her fear of men and to feel more comfortable on a leash. Betty is the kind of dog that needs love and compassion and is the reason why rescues exist. If you feel you can give her a chance, please apply to adopt her!

This sweetie is a great family dog as she is good with younger children, as well as other dogs. She is energetic and very playful... so playful that she's a bit too much for cats so she shouldn't be in a home with one. She loves her humans, too.

She has A LOT of energy and would be great for an active foster who can take her on runs, trips to the dog park, or play in a yard. If you're a less than active person, she will settle for day care or even better, she will get you on track with a fitness regimen (it's amazing how much less it feels like exercise when you have a loving dog by your side).

Her foster mom raves about how well-mannered she is! She's good on walks, in the crate, and has yet to have a potty accident (2 days into fostering). Add in her good looks, and she is quite the catch!

Bea's photos don't do her justice! She's a majestic and gentle hound mix, with the most adorable freckling. She can be a little timid and tentative at first, but once she sees your a friend, she opens right up and craves some attention. She is becoming more and more outgoing and social every day. 

Bea is good with both cats and dogs, and is just eager to please, making her a great candidate for training! She has a lot of energy and would do well with an active adopter who can run with her or take her to the dog park or day care. She does play by herself very well and keeps herself entertained if you have a securely fenced in yard. 

She is a new arrival, so we're still getting to know her. We will update her bio as we learn more about her.

Muppet Max makes Oprah a verb. Now that he is living in a foster home he is living his best life everyday. You have never met a dog who loves life more than this little man. This crazy looking guy is about 8-10 years old and 20 lbs. He is very friendly and good with other pups. He goes to the dog park every day and with his weight loss gets more engaged with the other pups all the time. He loves to pay ref when his big foster sister wrestles. Max would be a great first dog for someone in an apartment. He is quiet, clean and loves to snuggle. He is easy going with dogs and cats and has approached kids with enthusiasm. Max is great on a leash and is very gentle when walking. He would be an excellent choice for a Senior who wants a companion or a someone younger who would prefer walks instead of runs.

Like most shelter dogs, Max may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.

This adorable little guy is quite the character! He is playful and seems to get along with most pups. He has also been tested with children and did very well. His cat test was less successful; while we don't think he intended to harm the test kitty, he was a little too interested and excited by her, so we think he needs a home without cats.

Aside from his good looks, Roscoe seems to be a happy and social boy who adores affection. He was sadly surrendered to the shelter because his family could no longer afford to have a dog, and they really wanted what was best for the little guy. They said he was a purebred Basset from a breeder, but did not have papers. To us, he looks more like a Basset/Beagle mix. Whatever he is, he is so darn cute.

Dusty is a year and a half old lab/shep mix who loves walks, runs and WATER. We can confirm that Dusty enjoys water! She hopped around in the shallows like Tigger - it is hilarious! If you are looking for a great companion for adventures or just fetch, she is your girl. Walks have been good so far too, although she leaps at birds when she sees them, but she is working on this and with a little bit of patience, she will be awesome on leash. Dusty is busy learning commands and she's had great playdates with her fosters family's dogs too!

NEW ARRIVAL!!! NEW ARRIVAL!!! NEW ARRIVAL!!! NEW ARRIVAL!!! NEW ARRIVAL!!! NEW ARRIVAL!!!
 
This little lady is mom to a litter of beautiful blue eyed pups who will soon be available for adoption. Her babies are newly weaned and she has been a great mom, but now she needs to focus on finding a forever home! She is sweet as can be and perfectly sized.

Her life clearly hasn't been easy. In addition to being pregnant and landing in a high-kill shelter, she was heartworm positive and had to undergo painful heartworm treatment after her pups were completely weaned. Heartworm is a completely preventable disease, but she lacked the care and preventative medication needed. She was treated in early August and is on the road to recovery. She does have an activity restriction for another few weeks, but she is a calm girl and has been the best patient.

She is shy at first, but warms to her humans with some time, especially if you show her affection. She would do best with a patient adopter in a calm home, where she can have the space to come out of her shell. She is worth it, trust us! Because she is so shy with humans, she would be happiest in a home with another dog to help build her confidence. She needs a bit of stable living to learn that not all humans mean to bring her harm or neglect. She is good with other dogs and cats. 

Like most shelter dogs, Carmen may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.

This beautiful gal is affectionate, loyal, and loving. Bella is basically an oversized lap dog at home, and loves being close to her humans. She has come a long way since we rescued her. Initially fearful and dog-reactive, this girl attended training classes with her amazing foster and has learned how to be polite and confident, all with just some positive reinforcement and consistency. She's smart and eager to please, which makes her highly trainable.


From her foster: Meet Bella! She is a beautiful, loyal girl that loves to run and is just a bundle of energy. She wants to please her \""people\"" and has done really well with training as she is extremely food motivated. Although she has energy, she can be gentle when need be with the proper commands, but overall would make a great companion for an equally energetic family! She tends to get overwhelmed in large social gatherings (such as adoption events) and it is recommended for potential adopters to meet her in her foster environment, where she is comfortable and happy and can best show her true colors.

Bella will need an adopter who is committed to giving her lots of exercise, as well as continuing with her training. We recommend another training class for her with her adopter since it is about training the human as much as it is about training the dog! A class also has the benefit of building a closer bond between dog and human. We want to ensure her forever family continues to reinforce the positive behaviors so she can remain a confident and well-adjusted pup.

This gal has been overlooked for so long because of her reactivity towards other dogs, and she wonders if anyone will give the \""new Bella\"" a real chance at a loving forever home. She has worked hard for it, and she deserves nothing less.

Her foster reports that she is crate trained and has not had any accidents in the home. 

Like most shelter dogs, Bella may need a refresher on house training and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog. 

The adoption fee for this dog is $350. If you are interested in adopting Bella, please submit an adoption application at http://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/.DC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals. Please note that we cannot make any guarantees about age or breed; we rely upon our rescue partners and their veterinarians to make those assessments. We also cannot make any guarantees about housebreaking and animal temperament, as animals can behave differently through transition and in different environments.

Our shelter partners provide a basic vet screening for each animal we rescue, which includes necessary vaccinations, deworming, microchipping, and spay/neuter (unless the animal is too young or otherwise deemed by the vet to not be a good candidate for surgery). Please note that this is not a comprehensive medical exam and as such, may not identify any and all medical issues, though our goal is to flag any obvious health issues through the basic vet screening. We share all medical records with adopters and flag any known issues prior to adoption finalization.

Suspected Breed: Lab mix
Approximate Age: 9-10 years old and fabulous
Approximate Weight: 36 lbs
Personality: calm, sweet, and loves everyone	
Observations with Dogs: has done well with other dogs
Observations with Cats: has done well with cats
Observations with Kids: not yet tested with young children, but loves people
Currently Living at: DC area foster home

Foster reports Del is very friendly and great with other dogs and people, and also very affectionate! Just watch some clips of her and her!

When the shelter asked us to save this sweet senior, how could we say no? Just look at her adorable frosted face? How does a dog like this end up in the shelter, we wonder? How can the family she has been loyal to discard her because she is no longer young and playful? We see this all too often and it is heartbreaking. This dog deserves better and we will make sure she gets it.

Del clearly wasn't afforded many comforts in her previous life. She didn't know what the TV was in her new foster home, and stairs are also new to her. Good thing she is a fast learner and she is acclimating. She still prefers the safety of her crate, but is opening up more and more each day. As we learn more about her, we will update her biography.

Will you be her hero in her twilight years and show her the life of comfort and love she has always deserved? While she is calm and lower energy, this girl still has spunk and lots of life left in her. If you are also low key and don't mind slow walks around the block, Del is your gal!

Like most shelter dogs, Del may need a refresher on housetraining and crate training. We ask all of DC PAWS fosters to work on both house and crate training with their foster dog.

The adoption fee for this dog is $200 since she is a senior. If you are interested in adopting Del, please submit an adoption application at https://dcpawsrescue.org/adoption-info/adoption-application-dogs/DC PAWS Rescue does our best to provide accurate and complete information about our adoptable animals.

I do well with cats, I don't even notice they're around until there rubbing against me. I am crate trained and walk well on a leash. I am also trained to use the dog door in my foster's house and will need to go to a home with a yard. I love to go for car rides and hang out with my people. I like to go into the hardware stores because the workers give me treats! I do like to chase the squirrels on the fence (but I think that they are there for my enjoyment because they tease me). In the house I love to stare out the door or windows at the wildlife (squirrels, birds, bunnies, deer), but I don't like those pesky raccoons, don't worry I will keep the yard safe from them. I have been known to be a barker and know what a bark collar is. I sleep on a big comfy dog bed next to yours at night and will only get on the bed if you tell me it is ok. I take treats extra gentle and love fruits and vegetables. I love to chew on dog bones, and play with some toys. I like to go for walks and hikes, I like to play in the water and have been fishing in the mountains. I have been on a boat and love to have the wind just blow through my hair.
Truman will do best with an experienced dog owner/handler. If you are interested in adopting Truman, please submit an adoption application located on our website, coloradocaninerescue.org.

I am available for adoption through Colorado Canine Rescue (CCR), a nonprofit dog rescue located in the Denver area. I came to CCR from Canon City Colorado. There is very little history on me. CCR has been told I am a pit bull breed mix, but that is just a guess made by shelter staff, rescue volunteers, and our veterinarians.

It is said when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Well Kirie has had quite a few lemons handed to her in her 4 year life span, but definitely making the best lemonade that she can. Kirie was adopted out from CCR as a young dog but two years later wound up in the Aurora Shelter, having been abandoned. They called us so we could take her back into our rescue. Kirie has had TPLO surgery since being returned to us, going through training with a behaviorist, and a foster has worked diligently to get her past her pulling on the leash, and help her master her needs to attack water spouts and sprinkler heads.
Kirie still has separation issues, but does well in the foster home left with other dogs and free reign within the home. She is on a generic Prozac to help her manage with anxiety. Kirie loves to snuggle with her people on the couch and in bed and absolutely loves to give kisses. She is looking for a family that will give her plenty of attention, be home more than not, play fetch, take her on walks in the neighborhood. She adores children and is very gentle with them. Kirie so looks forward to rides in the car. She would enjoy being an only dog, but would do fine with a furry companion that has a laissez-faire attitude. She does best if the door is open or a doggie door for her to go out as needed. She needs a more experienced dog owner because she has been through so much in life.

If you are interested in adopting Kirie, please submit an adoption application located on our website, www.coloradocaninerescue.org. We are asking for a $200 adoption donation for Kirie. Kirie being a bully breed, will only be placed in communities that do not have a ban on bullies. Please note, CCR cannot guarantee the breed composition or ages of our dogs as we usually have no history prior to them entering the shelter. 9/15/19 5:01 PM"

Oatmeal has come to us from Detroit, where she went unclaimed as a stray. She does have a cherry eye that will be repaired along with her spay. We do not know her history, but she came to us with an old injury that took much of one of her ears.

Oatmeal is very sweet with people, but doesn't always care for other dogs and would likely be happiest being a spoiled only. She enjoys spending time outside and going for walks, and would appreciate a moderately active adopter. 

Oatmeal's adoption fee is $150. This includes all vetting including spay, vaccinations, deworming, and microchip.

Peyton is a female boxer, and is believed to be around 8 years old.

Peyton has come to us from Detroit animal control, where she had been turned in as a stray. She is underweight, and has a few masses that we will be removing once she puts on a few pounds. She came to us very shy and depressed, but is warming up nicely in her foster home. She is housebroken, and cohabitating with other dogs in foster, but takes VERY slow introductions - she would likely be happiest as a spoiled only.girl for her senior years. She does have some arthritic issues in her back end, but still does stairs well and is on some joint supplements. We believe she would do best in a home with older (teenaged) or no kids, and either as an only dog or with another older, respectful dog.

Sex: Female
Age: 4 years old
Coat: Red and white
Weight: 55 lbs and dropping
Activity Level: Active Pet

Molly is a beautiful red and white medium coated purebred border collie. She is incredibly sweet and really attaches herself to her person. She is biddable, thoughtful, and intelligent. She loves to play frisbee and fetch! She walks nicely on a leash, has excellent greeting manners, great recall, knows a bunch of tricks, housebroken, and crate trained, although doesnât need to be crated during the day as she is very well trained. She would be an awesome dog for the âweekend warriorâ because she can be calm during the week when you work and only have time for a walk and short fetch session but also be ready to hike and play all weekend long. 

Molly would prefer to be in a home with no other dogs and no small children. She is good with cats. 

Molly is located in Durham.  For more information, reach out to her foster mom, Mia, at mia.gulan241@gmail.com.  She will not be available until the end of October."

Fluff and CuddlesDrake is a stunning, super-sweet boy from an animal cruelty case in Eastern North Carolina. His rehabilitation has shown the true miracle of rescue. For months, Drake wouldn't leave the bathroom. He would be scared and shy -- and yet wanted affection.. would give you little licks on the hand. Given lots of time and love, Drake has done a total 180 and while still skittish, he runs around the house with his foster siblings, pounces on beds and couches, and plays joyously with toys. He has even started to vocalize when left alone-- he likes to have friends.

Potty training / leash training is still an issue. As of now, Drake is used to going on pee pads and while his aim is great, he does need to learn the yard.

Might you have the right home for this stunning, sensitive boy?"

She had very little coat and her skin was deeply infected. She did not have mange, just horrible flea dermatitis and a yeast infection. So after taking many rounds of mediation and having many medicated baths (that she did not enjoy, but was such a good girl!), we are happy to report that Glory has recovered and has grown a thick, healthy coat now.  

This sweet girl has likely never know a comfy life, but she is thriving in her foster home. She is house trained, will crate just fine (though we think she could be trusted loose in the house), gets along well with other dogs, loves to snuggle, and is so sweet and grateful.

We want to find Glory the loving home she's never had before. She is calm and would be great for retirees or for anyone who just wants a chill dog. Leisurely walks would be great...a back patio where she could relax with you would be fine and dandy too. She is low-maintenance and content. 

Glory does not require any further medication. Her skin is recovering well and she's now happy and healthy. It's a bit hard to tell how old she is because she was neglected so severely for so long, but we guess she's in the middle somewhere--maybe 7ish? A lovely age with a lot of great years ahead.

Will you be Glory's person? Will you give her life the happily-ever-after she deserves? Please complete the online application in the \""more about us\"" section. Placements considered within 300 miles of Tulsa, OK."

Here is his story:

About 10 years ago I got a call from a senior citizen who was trying to catch a stray pit bull in her neighborhood in Elkton. The dog would follow children around but eluded adults. She was worried the SPCA would pick him up and euthanize him. The Cecil Co SPCA had a \""no pit bulls\"" policy at the time. So for 3 weeks I tried to catch him, make friends with him, bribe him and for 3 weeks the SPCA was bent on catching him as well. Luckily, with the help of a butcher (who lived in the same neighborhood and had been giving him fresh beef) I was able to capture him. He was super friendly and hopped right in my car. We had him vetted and aside from a hairless patch on the top of his head he recovered from his ordeal pretty quickly.

I fostered him myself. He had a distinct hate of cats and for that reason I wasn't able to keep him permanently. He did get along with other dogs and was a well mannered guest. It was probably a year or so before he found his \""forever\"" home. Leroy seemed to have lucked out - he had a boy of his own and a big grassy yard. We didn't hear much from him after the initial settling in. There were other dogs to rescue and Leroy was starting his new life.

Fast forward about 4 years - tragedy struck and Leroy's family fell apart. His mom was sick, the house was in foreclosure, Leroy was living in an empty house. We got a call that the family could no longer care for him. Leroy came back.

Due to the family's lack of finances and the stress of it all, Leroy was in horrible shape. His skin condition which, looking back through vet records, had never been fully addressed. He was bald, scabby, bloody and thin. His head was sunken in. His hair loss was so great that you couldn't even distinguish what color he was. He wagged his tail.

Antibiotics and prednisone kicked back the skin a notch but again it never fully recovered. He developed demodex, a type of mange, due to the pred suppressing his immune system. We sent him to a foster home hoping to boost his spirits and give him more 1-on-1 care. Another vet was added to his repertoire. More antibiotics, supplements, shampoos but still his skin was slow to recover. Some prickly hair poked through but not as much as we had hoped for. He developed a sore on his ear and one on his toe which was so painful he didn't want to walk. A culture was done and revealed not one, but 3, drug resistant bacteria. One was resistant to ALL antibiotics. The drugs that we had been giving him were slowly killing him.

Fast forward to a year ago, stopped all Western medicine and enlisted the help of Always Helpful Veterinary Services & Dr Judith Shoemaker. The first visit was hours long as she worked up a plan and refining of supplements, powders and remedies. I noticed her lack of concern at the \""flesh eating bacteria\"" - a condition so bad that one vet wanted to amputate part of his ear and toe and another felt it was hopeless and he should be euthanized. She was most concerned with his painful eyes. He has a condition called entropean where the eyelids roll in and the lashes rub against the eye.

Leroy responded quickly under the watchful eye of Dr. Shoemaker. His coat came in glossy and now covers about 2/3 of his body. His skin still has flare ups but not more drug resistant bacteria. He was tested for food allergies and put on an appropriate diet. To someone meeting Leroy today, for the first time, he looks like a wreck - like he was just rescued. But to those of us who have seen him in the road to recovery, he looks beautiful.

Leroy has a pan pal who has him out every week for his medicated bath and some R&R. This same wonderful pen pal is covering most of his medical expenses (thankfully Always Helpful has a monthly payment plan!). She has offered to continue with his support even after he is adopted.

Leroy is now pushing 10 years of age. We would love for him to find his special home but if not, he is welcome to live his life out with us. Somewhere along the line he decided he didn't want to get along with other dogs - his Dr thinks it is because he felt so crappy. He has never lost his love of people - especially children. Leroy adores kids! He is currently getting a break from shelter life and is in a \""vacation\"" foster home for a few weeks. Check out the video his foster mom made for him.

He has had a prolapsed anus so he had surgery to tack his colon to his body internally. It has worked well and he is doing fine. Ellis is a sweet and goofy boy. He cannot climb a fence, but has climbed the gate when he sees a dog on the other side he wants to play with or he sees me. He normally does not try to get out, but would need to be supervised. He has a great personality and gets along really well with other dogs. He loves humans too. If you are interested in Ellis please fill out an application at labs4rescue.com.

September 15, 2019 Update from Ellis's Foster Mom in Connecticut: As soon as the Vet in Norwalk does his final exam, I think we will be taking Ellis to play with a neighbor chocolate lab. He wants to play so much when he meets other dogs. We have started dog obedience classes yesterday through our Park & Rec Dept. After all the initial craziness (6 dogs in class), he ended up doing pretty good. He is so friendly with people and children. Loves to be petted and loves to give kisses too. Rides well in the car. Is relatively calm and quiet in the house - until the doorbell rings. There is not an aggressive bone in his body. Likes to keep tabs on his people. Likes to lie at or under your feet.

Ellis's day is up at 6:30, Todd takes him out to potty. Back in for breakfast. Then a long walk around the property. Todd and I take him on walks around the yard. He seems to like laying outdoors. Does not bark at cars or bike riders. Late afternoon is a walk at the beach or the state park for an hour. Loves his dinner! And loves to chew his rawhide chew bone while in the living room with us. We go down to the barn to put the horses in and he loves gobbling up any grain they miss. Also he likes carrots. Around 9:30 he is tired and goes to sleep on his dog bed but will go into his crate at night when we go to bed. Boy oh boy, can that boy snore!

Ellis #2 is being fostered in Connecticut.

NorthStar Shih Tzu Rescue exists to benefit both Shih Tzu and Shih Tzu blend dogs and the people of our community. We operate as a no-kill rescue that provides rescue and adoption services, and meaningful outreach programs in order to advance the welfare of these companion animals, to serve and educate our community, and to make a positive, loving impact on the lives of both.

NorthStar, located in Excelsior, MN, actively works to rescue Shih Tzu and Shih Tzu blend dogs from dangerous environments and shelters with the ultimate goal of placing them in loving, permanent, adoptive homes. We rescue unwanted, abandoned, and abused dogs. We have them vaccinated, micro-chipped, spayed or neutered, provide other medical care, and rehabilitate them in carefully selected foster homes.

We also serve as a resource to our community and all pet owners by providing education and information on the benefits of adopting an animal in need as well as responsible pet ownership, including the importance of spay/neuter, good nutrition, and positive behavior training. We strive to increase public awareness about companion animal overpopulation, commercial breeders, and to offer solutions to end the killing of adoptable animals.

We work in alliance with local animal shelters, pounds, other rescue groups, and humane society organizations to ensure these animals are not forgotten.

This super cute guy is Trapper!! Poor Trapper came to us in pretty bad shape. He has scars and part of his lower lip is missing. But that doesn't keep this boy d
own. We are guessing Trapper to be approx 5 and weighs about 25lbs. He is such a sweet loving boy! He is all about cuddling with his human. Trapper is so happy go lucky! He gets along ok with other dogs, but he can be a bit growly if they get in his space. He is crate trained and now that he is neutered doing much better with the housebreaking. A fenced in yard and being let out frequently is helping him get it! Trapper wants nothing but a comfy couch to hang out on. With a loving family.

Hi!! My name is Maggie, I am a spayed dachshund and I am 8 years old and 12lbs, my foster mom says \""every girl needs her very own chihuahua\"" and guess what I have my very own attached to me at all times!! His name is Enzo, he is 11, neutered and I am his best friend, he follows me every where. I could probably do my own thing and live my life without him but I am not sure what he would do without me. I do love him and if he cries I am right there to make sure he is ok and lick his face, he isnt really as much of a social butterfly as I am but if I am around he does ok, so we must be adopted together! We both really like to snuggle under the covers with our person at night and I Maggie am happy to say I am house trained, we do well in a crate as long as we are together. We have been vaccinated, wormed, flea treated and micro chipped and we are just looking for that special someone willing to take on both of us, Enzo is going to need a little convincing, he just got used to our foster mom, but with some time an patience I think we would make perfect family members! If you would like to make us part of your family you can fill out an application at https://www.pethelpersinc.org/adoption-application our adoption fee is 300.00 we are being fostered in Morgantown WV

My name is Ethel Jane Starr. Apparently the other ladies at the senior home are talking and accusing me of having fake hair. Ladies, the only thing fake about me is my first home. These Pearl's cost me 5 dog bones and two poops outside. I am currently available to the right person. My needs don't come cheap. Think about vet care, my hair, my nails, jewels, and most importantly food! I like my fine dining. My age is in the double digits. I cant see or hear very well, but once I get used to your layout I am golden. I like to keep my bathroom habits private, but I know you are going to ask. Sometimes I take it outdoors or sometimes I take a poop on the pad. No depends for me yet. My foster mom says I am very loveable. I'm not very clingy or cuddly though. Unless you bride me with the lucky charm marshmallows. I like to take lots of naps on the local beds. I get along ok with the other seniors at the center and ignore the cats.

When you're alone, and life is making you lonely

You can always go

Starrtown

When you've got worries, all the noise and the furry

Seems to help, I bark

Starrtown Just listen to the music of the furries in the pound

Linger on the sidewalk where the stars in the sky are pretty

How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there

You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go starrtown, things'll be great when you're

Starrtown, no finer place for sure

Starrtown everyone's waiting for you!

Miss Petula Bark Starr is waiting for you at Starrtown! Petula would like a quiet home with no kids.

She does ok with other dogs, but would love to be the only child or with another laid back dog.

She does have a little food aggression, but who would want someone else touching their food.

Petula is a sweet girl. She is a little timid at first, but she knows you have to be cautious of people these days.

Petula takes Zonisamide twice day for seizures. Her seizures activity is low.

Little Miss Petula prefers to use pee pads, but loves the great outdoors if it is nice out.

Just a little picky about her bathroom choices, but peeing in the cold or rain is not a likely choice for any girl.

We believe Petula is 6 to 8 years old. This middle-aged looker still has lots of likes and licks left.

For more information about Petula email information@pethelpersinc.org, or to make her your new best friend, go to https://www.pethelpersinc.org/adoption-application/ to fill out an application.

My name is Daenerys (Daeny for short) and I am a Beagle/Pit mix about 5 years old weighing 45 pounds. I came to Pet Helpers with my 6 surviving pups and 2 other adult dogs that were my pack. I am an alpha female and it was my responsibility to bring them back food if I could find it and protect them. Some really nice folks followed me home one night and made it possible for ALL of us to be rescued. My puppies have all been adopted into wonderful homes and now it's my turn to find my Forever Family. I've been spayed, microchipped, updated on vaccines and tested negative for heartworm and Lyme. I'm house trained and crate trained, but I really don't need a crate...I'm a pretty laid back kind of gal. When I meet a new dog I have to be introduced properly and spend some time with them to feel comfortable. Because of this I do not do well in a dog park or out walking with other dogs I do not know. I don't like cats, I'll be perfectly honest with you. I love kids and adults though and love to give kisses. I'm easy to leash walk and I really like car rides. If you could please open your heart and home to me, I promise to be loyal and loving. I am fostered in Fairmont, WV, and my adoption fee is $150.00.

If you would like more information please email adoptionisforever@pethelpersinc.org.

If you think you might like to adopt and give this animal a forever home please fill out an adoption application to arrange a meet and great by clicking on the following link: https://www.pethelpersinc.org/adoption-application/ Once you meet the animal you can make your final decision on adoption!
For more information on this animal email adoptionisforever@pethelpersinc.org.

Pet Helpers is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foster based volunteer rescue located in Fairmont, WV. We do adopt out of state to approved applicants, if you are willing to drive to WV to pick up your pet. We do not fly or use transport companies. Our adoption fee is $150.00 for mixed breed puppies and adult dogs, $225.00 for full blooded puppies and adult dogs and $50.00 for cats and kittens. Regardless if the animal is a mixed breed or full blooded they are spayed/neutered prior to adoption IF they are old enough. If they are too young at the time of adoption, then it is your financial responsibility to spay/neuter the pet by the age of 6 months and you must provide proof for our files that it has been done. All of our pets are checked by a vet, given the shots appropriate for their age and any other treatment deemed necessary by the vet. All of our pets are adopted as indoor pets and are not be outdoors tied to a box 24/7. The pet you are adopting has been living in a home with a foster family. You are expected to take possession of the pet you are applying for within a few days of application approval. This will enable us to accept another pet into that home. Because we are a rescue, and believe that spaying and neutering is crucial in stopping the reproduction of unwanted puppies/kittens and massive amounts of animals dying daily in shelters across the country, we expect any animal already in your home to be spayed/neutered. If for any reason you are unable to keep the pet you have adopted you are required to return them to Pet Helpers, Inc. They are not to be sold or given away.

I love taking pictures of her because she has such an aura about her. She was rescued from an abandoned house in Far Rockaway with another dog during Hurricane Sandy by fellow rescuer Christine D. Ruby is a sweetie who has a playful side to her. She is about 8 years old now, and weighing in about 40lbs. She is always happy to see you and will shower you with affection, giving kisses all over your face. Ruby has a lot of energy and could probably win an Olympic sprint! So she would make a great running or exercise partner. She is a pocket pittie and not too big so she would be perfect for any home situation. Ruby needs some training as she can be a little mouthy during play or getting too excited. Currently in a foster home where she is doing well.  Let's find Ruby a home!

She is around 6 months of age and is expected to be somewhere between 30-40 lbs when full grown.
As a result of being a double merle Lady Bunny is completely deaf, blind in the left eye but does have some vision on the right.
It's very important to remember that she was born this way so she doesn't realize she's any different and it certainly doesn't slow her down at all.
She is a rather strong willed girl, very smart and high energy!
She is very treat motivated which has made training a lot easier!
So far she is doing fantastic with the hand signals for sit, down, stand, come, stay and spin.
She walks well on leash too.
She is fully crate trained and is doing great with house training.
Lady Bunny would do best with someone that is willing/able to continue her training. 
Aussies are a very smart breed and love to learn.
Lacking some vision from one eye and hearing doesn't change that.
Training is also a great bonding tool!
She absolutely loves playing with other dog's and would do great with another doggie companion.
It would be best for any potential doggie friends to have a more playful/high energy personality because we feel Lady Bunny would be rather overwhelming for an older more laid back dog.
She loves her people and is very attentive, meaning she checks in frequently without being reminded.
She stays too busy to be a cuddler though.
We are recommending she go to a home without small children due to the fact that when she gets overly excited, she can bite down a little too hard.
Not aggressively at all but it does pinch.
Being an energetic young puppy at times she still finds it difficult to keep all 4 paws on the floor when greeting people.
Lady Bunny isn't a fan of sharing her food or high value treats with doggie friends.
We have been working on this and she has made great progress so it very manageable.
Foster mom can fill you in on what we have been doing to work on the issue.
Lady Bunny is spayed, up to date on all vaccinations, current on heart worm/flea tick prevention and she is also microchipped.
We are requiring a meet and greet prior to adoption.
This is just to help ensure we get the best match possible for Lady Bunny as well as the potential adopter.
With her high energy level and love for playing with other dog's, we feel any existing dog's will need to meet her as well to make sure they don't feel overwhelmed by her high energy playful self.

This little brindle Pekingnese girl is just a puppy and such a sweet, silly precious girl! She joined us as an \""owner surrender\"" and we immediately recognized some trauma in her behaviors. She clearly wasn't treated very well in her precious life- which broke our hearts. We had a shy, scared little puppy that didn't understand how to really be a puppy. 2 months in foster care and tons of love later, and we have a confident, happy, silly playful girl and what could be better! Genie has been with children, cats, and other dogs. She does great with other dogs, is great with cats and also good with older children. Because of her uncertain past we recommend homes with children over 8 years old. (Ie- no tail pullers lol) 
Genie is under 20 pounds and around a year old.

Genie is now spayed, microchipped with lifetime registration, received all of her annual shots (rabies, distemper/parvo and bordetella) she has been dewormed, is current on flea treatment and heartworm prevention. She is HW negative. We also had her groomed.

She is mostly potty trained and we say mostly because she still is very young and will adjust to a new schedule fairly well. She is an \""excited pee-er\"" when greeted! She was once terrified of a leash and walks and now looks forward to them, we do recommend a harness. She is snuggly and goofy and loves her toys and wants attention and love. She is a joy and a wonderful pup. Since Genie doesn't require kids we welcome all applications on her as she would also be a wonderful companion pet!!!! 

Genie can be an only pet!
Fenced yard preferred not required.

If you'd like to meet this gorgeous girl and open your heart and home to her, send our adoption coordinator a message for an application. FishHawkTNR4@gmail.com

Buddy is a laid-back boy of 3 years and 45 lbs looking for a forever home.
Buddy - a low-rider hunk boy is the best way to describe him. Buddy could also stand to lose a few lbs. He's pretty chill and loves to carry around his toys in his mouth. His favorite things are humans and toys (in no particular order). He is fine with other dogs too but humans and toys are TOP OF HIS LIST. He walks well on leash and rides well in the car.
Buddy is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and preventives, and microchipped. He was recently cleared by the vet after heartworm treatment.
We are a foster-based rescue organization with foster homes throughout the state of Florida. We predominantly save dogs from municipal shelters throughout the Southeastern U.S. Our rescue dogs live in foster homes - there is no central facility.

Sheba is about 60 lbs and 5-6 years. She was found dumped on a farm and taken in by a loving family, but due to her incompatibility with farm animals needs to find a suitable forever home. She loves humans of all ages including children, and is very friendly and loving right off the bat. She would do well in a home with a companion dog, but it is not a requirement. She loves to play outside but not as much as napping at your feet and getting attention. She knows basic commands and is fine on leash but could use a refresher.

Sheba is housebroken, spayed and up-to-date on vaccines and preventives. If interested, please submit an inquiry and we will forward it to Sheba's current foster."

How was this guy an unclaimed stray at an animal shelter?? 

Pablo especially loves being rubbed on his head and behind his ears. So far he seems friendly with the other dogs here, but he draws the line at cats so should go to a home without kitties. 

Outside, he has a good bit of energy -- you'd never guess he is about 10 years old. Pablo can be a bit mouthy when excited, so, though he loves people of all ages, he is not recommended for a home with small children. 

Pablo is a courtesey post. For more information please call his rescue, Safe Shelter, at 814-485-1579 or 301-478-3206, or email them: safeshelterinc@yahoo.com.

Intake 7/5; Available for adoption on 8/2. 


- 17lbs

- Good with dogs and cats

- Good with men, women, children over 12

- Sweet but takes time to open up

Merlin came to us from a shelter in Florida. They estimated him to be 8 years old, and our vet thinks maybe 10-11 years old. He looks to have not been well cared for during at least part of his life, but he will never know what that is like again. The tops of his ears are missing, possibly from either trauma or frostbite. He wasn't neutered. His ears were horribly infected with pseudomonas, maybe even MRSA. Our vet thinks he had some past trauma to part of his cervical spine, and either that or the ear infection causes a head tilt - which looks pretty cute. It doesn't seem to bother him.

We began working on the ear infection with antibiotics and drops, and his ears are doing much better. There is irreversible damage inside that was done, and he has some hearing loss. Since treating the ear infection, he seems to have recouped some hearing and is responding to us when we call him loudly or if he hears a loud noise. Bonus: thunderstorms don't bother him!

Merlin is a sweet dog but took a few days to start showing personality. Now he is goofy, even playful sometimes! He is a Velcro dog with his foster mom and follows her everywhere she goes. He LOVES car rides. He sleeps with his foster parents at night and doesn't move all night. He has learned to walk on a leash and does so very nicely. He loves getting petted on his face, and he lovvvesss getting his back rubbed above his tail. He dances his rear so hard that sometimes both legs come off the ground at the same time.

Merlin is definitely a Crested because he despises grass. He has gotten really good about using the potty outside, but he has to be set outside most of the time. He won't go out far in that treacherous grass, so sometimes we carry him to the far corner once or twice to make sure he has finished up his business. Housetraining is coming along nicely.

Also a classic Crested trait, is separation anxiety! Merlin says he wants a home where someone is almost always home. He is not a candidate for anyone who works away from home or who is routinely gone for more than a few hours. He will howl and howl and howl if he is separated from his people! Because of that, he also cannot live in attached living because the neighbors may not appreciate his singing.

Perhaps not a Crested trait, but maybe just a trait for anyone who really loves their sleep... Merlin doesn't like being woken up when it's time to leave the couch and go to bed at night. There is no picking him up and waltzing off to the bedroom. Merlin will not just growl, he will warning snap and be annoyed that his beauty sleep was interrupted. We think this is partly because he doesn't want to be bothered, but we also think a big part of it was his ear infection hurting him. He has gotten so much better with every night. We have found it's easiest to just tug on his blanket until he gets up, and that is working well. He's also very food motivated, so if a treat is dangled in his face, he gets right up. We believe in time, this reaction would go away. His ears are feeling better, and he has started to feel settled and at home.

He has allowed people to pet him when on walks, but he has demonstrated body posture that says he does not want them to pet him, so we ask people not to pet him. We feel that will get better with more practice and socialization too, but we like to err on the side of caution and keeping him feeling comfortable.

Merlin loves car rides! He would be great company for anyone who takes long road trips. His foster family takes him along on errands all the time because he really loves it.

Overall, Merlin is a really great dog and is going to make someone the best companion. He is super sweet, adores his foster mom (even our vet commented on that), and the rest of his family are pretty cool too when she's busy. He cannot be placed in a home with children under 12 years old. 

Merlin is up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and is microchipped. His senior blood panel was great. He had a dental on 7/10.  He will be ready for adoption on August 2.

He's currently being fostered in Bradenton, FL (Manatee County). Bobby is a sweet sweet Jack Russell mix who would love to have a forever home! Other dogs?? That's okay!! By himself?? That's okay too. What Bobby does is roll with the punches. He came to us from a very high-kill shelter in Florida. He has had surgery twice for removal of benign growths. We have not had to do anymore surgeries. He came through with flying colors, considering he is heartworm positive. He will be treated in August, and we are looking for a foster, that can carry him through heartworm treatment, ideally fall in love with him and adopt him. Best. Jack. Ever. He is not noisy, but barks when you come home, not a crazy busy Jack. Loves to go out and explore. He even swims. He loves to be loved on. Follows you around. Expert lizard and fly chaser. Loves toys, balls and squeakies.. Walks great on lead, and loves to ride in the car. He is the perfect companion. He will sleep when you do, be active when you are. He would like someone that is home a lot, or another dog to keep him company. Fenced yard is preferred, but not sure he needs one. He seems to want to stay with you. Crates easily, housebroken, just an all around good guy. Heartworm treatment will be done in St. Petersburg, so the ability to take him to treatment is a must. Bobby is the perfect companion dog.
We are a foster-based rescue organization with foster homes throughout the state of Florida. We predominantly save dogs from municipal shelters throughout the Southeastern U.S. Our rescue dogs live in foster homes - there is no central facility. If interested in meeting one of our wonderful adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at

I am about 2 years old. I have beautiful Golden Eyes, a petite girly figure      (57 Lbs.) and a short soft coat.  I recently had puppies that were taken from me by someone as they werenât with me when I was found roaming around in the wild to fend for myself.  I was Picked up by a very small rural shelter and sadly my days were limited if not adopted. I was very scared, almost crippled with fear in the shelter.  The good people at Lab Rescue found out about me and have given me a chance to find a  forever home.
 
Bob my foster dad believes I must have lived in a home for most of my life because I know all of my house manors and commands.  I am potty trained.  I like to ride in the car and enjoy going on walks. I am good on a leash but could use some obedience training when I see some different things.  Since I have been with Bob, I have not let him out of my sight. I am always in the same room with him. I guess I am fearful about being abandoned again.  I very much like to snuggle.  I will lay on your shoulder or next to you on the couch when ever you let me. I enjoy playing with a tennis ball. Playing fetch in the yard is nice or I will roll the ball around the house and play by myself.  I also enjoy chewing on a stuffed bone and recently started playing with stuffed animals.  
Bob says I am very smart and eager to learn more.  I did not have ID when I was found so no one knew my name. I was give a new name Bella (Beautiful!) and started responding to my name in less that 2 weeks.  I might do best as an only dog but they say we will see once I get my paws under me and settled a bit more.  I am just catching my breath and going through Hormonal changes. It would nice to have backyard to run in, play fetch or to just hang out looking at the squirrels.  I do not like to go in the water.
 
Right now I am just a little girl looking to be loved and give my unconditional love to a nice family.
Please call Bob and come visit me in Sarasota.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read about me. Have a nice day

Toby loves being around other dogs. He is energetic and playful, but also submissive. The two dogs in his foster home have helped his adjustment immensely. He does okay with older kids, but may not be a good fit around younger ones. He chases the cat living in his foster home, but hasn't tried to hurt her. As he has been adjusting to his foster home, he has growled and barked at the members of his foster family. However, he responds well to verbal correction, and this behavior is declining in frequency as he becomes more comfortable.

Toby is very companionable and likes being around people. He follows his foster mom around the house keeping her company in various rooms. His only really bad habit is that he likes to chew, with a particular affinity for shoes and cords. This can be easily managed by providing bones and toys, and keeping human things picked up. Toby shows his Basenji heritage with unusual vocalizations in addition to little barks and growls.

Toby's ideal forever home would be with a family who is patient enough to allow him to acclimate at his own pace. The perfect home for Toby will have at least one other dog, and no young kids. They will also have the ability to tolerate toileting accidents, and to remember to pick up things he's likely to chew. Toby is a smart, resilient little guy, who will be a wonderful addition to his forever family.Toby has a $150.00 adoption fee plus the cost of 6 months of heartworm prevention.

Good With Children: Yes
Heartworm Status: Negative

Dale is a very sweet boy who came from an animal neglect case out of Bibb County. Even though he had a rough start at life, he has a lot of love to give and hasn't let his past define him. He does well with some dogs, and we would say he's selective, but we always require other companions to meet dogs prior to adoption to ensure it is a great match for everyone. He especially loves likes female dogs and submissive dogs that appreciate his status as being his own man.

 He does well with everyone, including small children. He's a very intelligent boy. He thinks he is macho when he is in an environment where he knows what to expect, but with new situations - like the first time he met nail clippers, he turned into a squeaky little mouse in about ten seconds. He gains confidence quickly in new places, and likes to go for walks in his harness. He's stubborn and good natured. Dale is a proud, dapper guy that likes to patrol his grounds, go for walks, and get his back scratched. He is soft like a teddy bear. He is the perfect model who doesn't mind being dressed at all!

Raiden is a beautiful Shepherd/Husky mix that is intelligent, goofy, energetic, and excited about life. If youâre looking for a buddy thatâs always ready to party, Raiden is your boy. Raiden would love to live a fairly active lifestyle that might possibly include hiking, exploring, and playing with other dog friends. 

Raiden was pulled by us from a local animal control after his stray hold was up, and his owners, if any, did not come forward. For the life of us, we donât know why they didnât bother- Raiden is wonderful! He lights up a room when heâs around. 

Raiden has many of the personality traits of both a husky and a shepherd. He is intelligent, fairly energetic, playful, and obedient- and to top it all off, heâs a stunner with those eyes that everyone notices at first glance. He learns by watching and example. Raiden walks well on a leash and does well in a crate. We believe he is house trained based on behavior at the rescue. Raiden is a joy to have around and is ready for his forever family! 

Please note due to Raidenâs breeds he does shed a lot.

Peggy is a spitfire, inquisitive, adventurous pinup of a girl that loves  to explore, catch frogs, and eat. Peggy walks well on a leash and rides well in a car.  She prefers to ride shotgun, in a car, and in the ride of life. She does well at the vetâs office and is fearless and independent in every situation.  Peggy has all of the stubborn and intelligent traits of a dachshund. She is very smart and knows how to sit and wait on command. Training her to do more commands would do well both for her mental aspect and to bond with her. 

Peggy has spent time with cats and shown no interest in them in the past. She enjoys romping and adventuring outside, at her own pace and in her own time. She is the kind of girl that would love nothing more than to take an African safari if given the opportunity in order to hunt new adventure. Peggyâs ideal home would include a family that understood the personality traits of a dachshund and could allow her the independence of a teenage human and opportunities to explore that she so greatly craves. She is not interested in being coddled and dressed up, but she is interested in being a companion. If you think Peggy is your girl, please see our contact info below!

Tank is a handsome hunk, who came to us after being discovered as an unclaimed stray by a local farmer. Tank has been treated for heartworms and has worked hard spending time learning how to be a dog. He tries very hard and is eager to please his human. Tank knows how to sit and wait on command. He walks well on a leash and rides well in a car. He does well in a fenced in area, and loves to socialize with people. He is big and sloppy, and a very good boy.

 Tank is the kind of boy that needs a confident owner. Because of his shady, we assume horrible, past and the things he has had to learn with us, we think that he spent a lot of time without food, water, love, and guidance. As such, he is not a fan of sharing his food or toys, as he is scared someone will take them away from him. He doesnât mean to be rude, but he will try and push boundaries if he isnât given proper restrictions, thus the need for breed experience in his adoption. Tank has been working hard to gain weight since his bout with heartworms and being dumped. He is still in need of gaining more weight and is continuing to work on this while he waits for his forever family to find him. If Tank finds a compatible dog friend, he must be fed separately from the other dog in the home. Tank is a good boy, he just needs guidance to be the best boy he can be in your particularly lifestyle. Interested in Tank? Check out our application below!

Tony the Tiger perhaps should have been named âTony the Tiggerâ after the Winnie the Pooh character- this sweet boy is joyful, happy, bubbly, talkative, and a silly clown. Itâs impossible to be around him and not smile! Tony walks great on a leash and would love to have a family of his own!

She is a Blue Pitbull Terrier/German Shepherd/Rottweiler Mix. She is very friendly, adventurous and LOVES any sort of affection. Would make a great family dog. Branna has been with us most of her life as the last of her litter to come through our doors because she is a princess and wants to find just the right family that appreciates her and sees her as the center of their universe. 


She's a big fan of chasing tennis balls and toys, and she's all about sitting on your foot when things are slow. Branna-Banana is very eager to please. She loves people very much is as careful to watch facial expressions in order to anticipate the next move or adventure, and listens attentively so she knows best how to please. She's a very intelligent girl. 

She is obedient and is downright cuddly when a lap presents itself - she has no idea she's more than 20 lbs! She is a good companion dog to the right person and situation and such a goofball. Branna is a total cuddle bug for folks and so eager to please she sin danger of turning herself inside out at times. She gives the best kisses around and thinks she is a lapdog, especially when she gets scared. She's is playful and goofy and gentle and fun loving with folks.

Benny is a goofy, good-natured, initially shy boy that likes to sneak up in your heart when youâre not paying attention and just steal it away. Benny came to us when a lot of new changes happened in home and he and his owners, though all doing their best, couldnât quite make the transition. 

Benny loves to play. He is gentle and silly. He has the biggest smile in the entire world, and it lights up the room when he gets his behind scratched. Benny loves treats and is gentle in taking them. He walks wonderfully on a leash and is doing well with crate training. He is housebroken and has no known allergies at this time. He is lean in build and due to his Labrador heritage tries very hard to come up on point, but those ears just wonât quite cooperate, much to our amusement.

Benny is a wonderful boy that would make a solid family dog. Benny weighs approximately 55 lbs. He is currently available for adoption and is just waiting for your application to come through!Â

Austin is a stunning German Shepard Mix. He is house trained and fully vetted. He is good with kids, other dogs, and cats. He was rescued from an abandoned house along with his siblings. He is feral and is about 70% rehabbed. He would do best in a home with other dogs. His perfect adopter would be one that not only understands his situation but is willing to put the time in to teach him his job, which is to be a good family dog. He is very responsive to teaching but needs personal attention on his journey to being at peace with being a family dog. He has been with a professional trainer and knows commands and does very well on the leash for a young age. He needs to be with a family who understands and embraces his shyness and can continue to work with him.Â

Amos came to us from a horrible abuse/neglect case, but that has not broken his spirit in the slightest. He is very friendly and loving and would love to have a family to call his own! His favorite things include belly rubs at any time of day, for hours at a time if possible, chicken, hugs, and kids. He is a large, lightly toasted marshmallow that can be squished at will and will distribute big sloppy kisses upon request. He would LOVE to steal your couch! He is a good boy, who is gentle and sweet. He has no known allergies and loves to get treats at every golden opportunity. Appreciative of butt scratchies at any time of the day, he likes to chill in the backseat for car rides. He is easy going and doesn't mind a jaunt around the yard. He does fine on a leash. He is afraid of thunderstorms and turns into a bowl of jello at the first rumble of thunder.Â

Heartworm Status: Negative. Alice had heartworms and has recently had her injections. We expect her to be negative at the end of her rest period portion of heartworm treatment. 

Alice and her sister Libby came to us from a truly horrible neglect situation in late 2018. You see, Alice and her sister were found chained in the back of an abandoned rental property in Fort Valley. They had clearly been used to make puppies, probably for sale. Their owners, to use the term as loosely as possible, had abandoned them when he left the rental property. Alice and Libby were both terrified when they came to us. They had clearly had zero medical care and bare minimum human contact. 

Now, however, after many months of love and patience, Alice and Libby both are noticeably coming into their own personalities and relaxing. They have received medical care and are up-to-date on their needs, and have filled out nicely with good food. Alice is 40 pounds. Both Alice and Libby are on the hunt for their forever homes, either together or separately. 

She took to having a soft bed and a full food bowl like a duck to water. It has truly been gratifying to watch her progress over the last few months. Alice enjoys her food with gusto and gets excited when she is inside the rescueâs buildings with other dogs around her. She picks up on the energy of those around her and excels when there is love and happiness proffered to her.

Alice is ready for the next steps in her life. She has come around beautifully! She is a maternal in nature, friendly, initially bashful, goofy, silly girl that can rock pearls and bathe in a pool of water all in the same half hour. She loves to play with her canine friends at the rescue, of which she has many, large and small. She is not averse to meeting new people, although she is very bashful about it initially. She is a gentle girl that is shy about learning new experiences, but does so anyway, sometimes when youâre not looking. Alice walks perfectly on a leash and seems to appreciate the idea that an adventure awaits her at the leashâs destination. While she does not enjoy riding in a car, she simply turns into a puddle of sadness in the backseat or her crate while on the ride.

Aliceâs ideal home would include a family that understands her past trauma and knows that there is going to be teaching and patience involved in helping her heal from the wrong done to her. We look forward to seeing her continue to blossom into the beautiful flower she is.

Libby is a beautiful chocolate swirled brindle girl that is shy and wants to be so friendly, but is still learning how to trust. Libby came to us after a call came in from the local police department asking for assistance in evaluating whether two dogs they had been put in charge of were aggressive or not. Imagining the worst, instead our staff manager and assistant found two miserable, broken hearted little dogs huddled behind a recently deserted rental property, chained up and terrified. Libby and what we suspect to be her biological sister Alice, were left to fend for themselves for an unknown period of time. They were both a horribly strong heartworm positive, crawling in insects, and had lost some hair and most of their self confidence. They have truly seen the very worst that this life, and humans, have to offer. 

After many months of gentle and consistent care by our loving staff, Alice and Libbyâs personalities are both blossoming. While Alice has bloomed a bit faster than Libby, Libby is starting to get the hang of it. She is still learning to trust. Libby is afraid of new situations and only wants to be feel safe, warm, and well fed. She takes great confidence from her sisterâs and other dogsâ presences and does best when she is around other dogs. She enjoys romping with them when she thinks no one is watching. She is still learning. She doesnât really understand what toys are, she doesnât understand what it is to be in a stable home life. But she does understand when kindness is shown to her. She does understand a soft dog bed and the companionship of other dogs. She does understand when her food bowl being consistently full, and she is so grateful! 

Libby is 37 pounds. She has been fully vetted, her heartworms treated and her skin cleared up. She does walk well on a leash. She understands and appreciates having a safe place to hide, her crate. Libbyâs ideal home environment would include a safe, loving, and perceptive family that understand her past trauma and is willing to work with her to teach her that she doesnât have to be afraid of this life. She would probably come to her full potential in having another dog friend that she can learn from and follow after as part of her pack. Libby is not broken, but she does need guidance to continue to grow- but donât we all need something like that?

Molly is sweet, small girl that weighs approximately 30 pounds. Molly and her best friend in the world, Callie, were trapped by another local rescue and brought to us for help. From the way that they act, it is clear that they have had very little socialization prior to their coming to live with us. Callie has since found her forever home and is thriving in a stable, happy, calm home environment. We have continued working with Molly, and she is now able to walk on a leash quite comfortably and accept pets from the staff. She is able to be touched and handled; she freezes on contact.Â 

Molly needs a family or individual that will devote significant time to her and show her that the world is nothing to fear. She needs someone to teach her that life is a happy place, where there is love and nothing to be afraid of. Molly socializes well with other dogs and is all about playing with them and romping in the yards on a regular basis. She enjoys rough housing with multiple large canine friends and appreciates hanging out with our other resident small dogs. While she has not met a cat at the time of this writing, based on her temperament and reaction to small dogs, we donât think cats would be an issue, although we would of course test prior to any placement with them. She is sweet, good-natured, and happy, just unsure of what is acceptable and what is not, so her ideal home would be willing to show her all of that.

Because of Mollyâs current fears, she will require multiple meet and greets to ensure both she and her potential adopters are comfortable with each other.Â

Norah came to us with what we are guessing is her biological family member, Margo in mid-2018 from what was initially described to us as a hoarding case in Twiggs County. As we learned more about their origination, our hearts broke for these poor mama dogs. Because when they came to us, they did indeed have three puppies between them, all three of which were approximately 6 weeks old. Norah and Margo have been through a personal purgatory that if a person had gone through, they would be hailed as superheroes. They and 36 other dogs of similar breed and ages were on a property under what from all reports has been described as a den of horrors. None of them had any sort of medical care, all were living in pens outside with little to no shelter. Many had teeth rotten from a steady diet of white bread. Little to no human contact was given to any of them.

Despite all of this, they were the best moms to their puppies. The puppies grew up and have since found forever homes of their own where they are loved and cared for. Norah and Margo both have spent extra time with us learning about people, socializing with other dogs, and getting plenty of medical care and a steady diet of good food. They have both been so appreciative. Itâs truly been a wonder to see their personalities blossom! 

Norah is a flirt. She likes to give you a big puppy smile and dance away from you just out of reach when you go to tickle that little pointy face of hers. Her zoomies are the best; sheâs like a blonde tornado of glee. She likes treats and to dance with Margo. Sheâs a rough and tumble tomboy that likes laid-back personalities in her canine companions. She gets along great with our small dogs and plays in the yard with them every day. She does fine with other big dogs as long as they arenât overly dominant. Despite her horrific past, she has no problems with things like food or resource guarding. Sheâs a soft, gentle, big bottomed girl that is still learning about how nice it is to be part of a pack that includes people. She is not a fan of the camera shutter sound and pretends to be a walrus with big eyes when itâs around.

Norah is still learning the ropes of walking on a leash completely comfortably, and she is making good progress. Her ideal family would include someone that appreciates her courage and is willing to give her the patience and love she needs to bridge that last gap of going from rescue dog to full fledged, comfortable member of a family. It may take her a couple of meetings with her potential family to really get a good sense of her goofy personality; this will be determined by our manager on a case-by-case basis. Norah tips the scales at approximately 60 pounds.

Name: Zennith
Breed: German Shepherd
Age: Approx. 5 Years as of April 2019
Sex: Female
Good with Dogs: Yes, however no small dogs. Also because of her past she is picky until she gets to know the dog.
Good with Cats: No
Good with Kids: Yes, although older teenagers if any are preferred. 
Heartworm Status:  Negative. Zennith had heartworms and has recently had her injections. We expect her to be negative at the end of her rest period portion of heartworm treatment. 

Zennith came from a tough family situation by way of Macon-Bibb Animal Welfare (animal control). Zennith spent the first portion of her life living with her then mate, Apollo, and two of their puppies, all of whom are currently with us. While their owner truly did love them, none of them received adequate medical care and were in a half-starved, terrified state when they came to us in late 2018. From what we know, they had spent their lives living outside exclusively and had rarely met other dogs. They were scared, defensive, and worried about their survival. After many months of gentle and persistent socialization and getting her up-to-date on medical care, Zennith is ready to find her forever home!

Zennith is a maternal, solid girl that tips the scale at 75 pounds. Her thick fur and sweet personality remind us of a teddy bear. She has learned to walk on a leash with us, and appeciates having a âsafe zoneâ in the form of her crate. She is working hard to learn about potty training and is doing better by the day. Zennith is a highly intelligent girl that learns well and pays close attention to her handler. When she first meets people, she is a little stand off-ish until she realizes that they are her friend. Because of this, Zennith may need multiple meeting with her new family before she is ready to hop in the car with them and go home. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis with our manager. When Zennith is comfortable with her people and surroundings, she opens up like the delicate blossom that is her personality. She is loyal to her handler and focused on learning. While she isnât overly playful and is quite serious, she is a good girl that appreciates all that she is given. She is gentle and an example of what it means to be a strong survivor of tough situations. Zennith is ready for her forever family that can continue to show her the ropes of being part of a family!

Good with Cats: Unknown, Can test for approved applicant upon request 
Good with Kids: Yes
Heartworm Status: Negative. Darcy is on her crate rest phase of her heart worm treatment, and we expect her to be negative at the end of her treatment cycle! 


Darcy is a sweet tempered, gentle, loving little warrior. She came to us as an unclaimed stray who had clearly been severely neglected to the point that every bone in her body was visible to the naked eye. Her large, pleading eyes tore us up right down to the soul. Thankfully, she found her way to us where she has blossomed on the outside into the beautiful girl that we have always seen that she is on the inside. 

 Despite her hard beginning, Darcy is a sunbeam of happiness. She loves people very much and worships the ground they walk on. She is gentle and well-mannered and loves to romp with her dog friends here at the rescue. Because of her hard beginning, Darcy has a touch of separation anxiety and wails like a broken soul when she is initially left alone in a crate. She does overcome this given a bit of time, but her crate just isnât her favorite place to be, although she is grateful for a soft bed to sleep on inside of it. While she is physically finishing up the healing process of her past, her emotional resistance to being separated from her folks is likely to linger a while longer. 

Darcy is still learning how to walk well on a leash, her future adopter should be aware she may do better with a harness and a little more thorough training. When she is excited, which is always especially evident when there is food around, her stumpy little tail hits warp speed. She is a very endearing little girl that only wants someone to love her and appreciate her. She is a doll and ready for her forever family to find her! She weighs in at 35lbs of pure love!

Patches is a sweet, small little boy who has a minor cleft palate which will never require surgery and doesn't bother him at all. He weighs in at approximately 30 pounds and is not expected to grow any larger. He is a forever puppy! Patches and his brother Murphy were picked up as strays by a caring couple; they found them on the side of the road in a ditch with their deceased father. We have been working with them, and Patches is now able to walk on a leash and accept pets from the staff. Where he once was so afraid of anyone trying to handle him, now Patches has come alive and is ready to play, play, play! Patches is a HUGE fan of doggie-daycare-playtime! 

Patches needs a family and best friend of his very own! He needs to continue to experience new things, like sleeping on a couch or how to fetch and return a toy. Patches socializes well with other dogs and is all about playing! He enjoys rough housing with Murphy and the other small and large dogs at the rescue. He appreciates romping with our other residents, and is easy going and non-discriminating about his friends. He is sweet, good-natured, and happy, just unsure in new social situations, but willing to learn with patience from his handler.

Murphy is sweet, small little boy that weighs in at approximately 30 pounds and is not expected to grow any larger. He is a forever puppy! Murphy and his brother Patches were picked up as strays by a caring couple, they found them on the side of the road in a ditch with their deceased father. We have been working with them, and Murphy is now able to walk on a leash and accept pets from the staff. He is very mild mannered and shy and enjoys scratches although they are clearly a new thing for him. Murphy is able to be touched and handled; he freezes on contact, but we can tell he does appreciate being around people very much. 

Murphy needs a family or individual that will devote time to him and show him that the world is nothing to fear. He needs someone to teach him that life is a happy place, where there is love and nothing to be afraid of. Murphy socializes well with other dogs and is all about playing. He enjoys rough housing with Patches and the other small dogs at the rescue and appreciates romping with our other resident small dogs. He is sweet, good-natured, and happy, just unsure of what is acceptable and what is not. 

Please note - because of Murphyâs current fears, we feel it would be best for his potential adopters to meet with him on several occasions.

Shane is a strong, handsome, genial, excited-about-life, sunny, joyful kind of boy. Shane is also a fighter. Shane came to us when the county sheriff's department found him on the side of the road after having been hit by a car and apparently laying in a ditch for at least a few days. Shane's back legs were shattered, and he has been through extensive surgery and is beginning his physical therapy that includes strengthening, short walks. He is named after his rescuer and friend in the police department, whom we are so grateful to for saving this lover. Shane never stopped smiling through the entire ordeal of surgery, healing, and growing. The surgeon that performed surgery on him got a real kick out of his excited, happy personality while he was recovering. If you couldn't see his funny haircut, you'd never know anything horrible had ever happened to him. Watching him heal has been a true miracle and example of cheerful determination to us all at the rescue.

 Shane is an active, perky, silly clown of a little boy that loves life and lives it to its fullest. He is a youngester that loves to play until he drops, and can get impatient with the movement restrictions he has had placed upon him until recently so that he can heal properly. Shane is a lover. He would do well in any family structure. Shane is approximately 30 pounds and we do not believe he will grow to be a very large dog and will stay in the medium sized dog range. Shane walks well on a leash and has done well riding in the car. He is crate trained and housebroken.

Name: Lucy (4)
Breed: Belgian Malinoise
Age: 3 years old (as of 2019)
Sex: Female
Good with Dogs: Yes
Good with Cats: No
Good with Kids: Yes, ages 12 and up. 
Heartworm Status: Negative

Lucy is a gentle, observant, spunky, athletic, intelligent girl that was surrendered to us when her owner's changing living situation moved her near a herd of goats. Rather than see her and her brother meet untimely ends due to not being able to turn down the chance to snack on goats, Lucy and her brother Buck are now looking for homes! At the time of this writing, we request that they be adopted together, although we may be willing to consider attempting to separate them if the right home comes along. 

Lucy is a sweet, classy girl that absolutely loves chasing a laser pointer. She is all about playing with toys of any variety, and has deep concentration on her tasks at hand. She knows the following commands: Sit, stay, roll over, shake (from both paws!) and likes to chase frisbees. Lucy tends to pick one person and really stick with them and become her best friend, although she is amenable to people of all walks of life. 

When Lucy was a puppy, she managed to get into some pesticide, and suffered a small reaction to it. This has had no long term affects that must be maintained, although she does \""space out\"" a bit when a loud noise occurs near her, like a gunshot or fireworks. She is quick to snap out of it and it has no lasting affects on her behavior. Lucy is a bit of a Houdini that requires a supervising eye on her. 

Lucy rides great in a car and is approximately 60 pounds and enjoys being fattened up!

Lucy is a quick learner and very gentle with people she has just met. She walks wonderfully on a leash and listens to her commanding person with attention. One of her favorite games is to be told to sit, and then see how long she can hold it while her person goes on about their business. She likes having a \""job\"" but she does not depend on it for her life's purpose. She loves her brother Buck very much, and we would simply love to see them find their forever - and goat free- home together!

Name: Genesis
Sex: Female
Breed: American Boxer
Age: Approximately 10 years as of February 2019
Good with Dogs: Yes, though no small dogs.
Good with Cats: Yes
Kids: Yes. Genesis LOVES children of all ages!
Heartworm Status: Positive. Due to her age and somewhat compromised immune system, we feel it is risky to put Genesis through heartworm treatment and are opting for the \""slow kill\"" method.

Genesis is nothing but solid love in a goofy, awkward footed, happy-go-lucky 65 pound butterball of happiness. She is every bit as wonderful to hug as she looks, and is nothing but a huge sponge of love and kisses! Genesis lost her family the week before Christmas in December of 2018 when her family went through a divorce. She has been heartbroken, and doesn't understand why the kids that she loves so much haven't come back for her. She is the epitome of compassionate, eager-to-please love. She would be perfect as a kind of therapy dog for older, younger, and every age in between people, and a best friend to anyone that extends the hand of friendship to her. Genesis is wonderful! She loves hugs, but most of all she really love bellyrubs. She immediately falls to the floor when you offer and starts to roll around, asking for you to continue, much to our amusement.

Genesis is crate trained and loves everyone that she meets, whether they are canine or human. We believe she has lived with cats before, but we would be willing to test this again if needed. However, we do think she would be fine with them. She walks great on a leash and listens well to her humans. She wants nothing more than to love, please, and be loved in returned.

As mentioned, Genesis has a somewhat compromised immune system because she has skin cancer on her belly. It has been removed to give her some comfort. The cancer also accounts for the spots on her face. They do not seem to bother her on a day-to-day basis. Please consider opening your heart and home to this perfect girl! Somewhat older does not mean that there is no love left to give.

Harper is a beautiful German Shepherd that is a credit to her lineage in terms of looks and personality. She has a drive to do a good job. Harper listens attentively, and works to follow commands the best she knows how. We really think that she would do well under any sort of training her new family would care to put her through. Harper is the kind of girl that would excel as a working dog with a job. Harper's ideal family would involve no kids, but instead a couple or a single person looking for companionship and looking to have a lifelong friend that they could devote their attention and patience towards.Harper is does well in her crate and great on a leash. She likes to have a job to do, and takes her job of patrolling the grounds seriously. She has taken it upon herself to be the guardian of our staff, and she loves her people very much. Harper isn't much for toys, but instead prefers to be on guard and working. She loves chicken! She is great at catching treats and rarely misses. She is very careful with her food not to alarm the person offering it to her. She is quite gentle with people that she knows are the alpha. Harper is currently 75 pounds. Harper is very intelligent and quite serious.Harper may require multiple meet and greets to get an accurate gauge of her personality.

Lilly and what we presume to be her sibling Mack, came to reside with us after they were dumped at a local elderly couple's home. Lilly manifests her anxiety at the stress of having to fend for herself for an undetermined period of time prior to coming to us by not wanting to deal with other dogs at the present time. She would prefer to be an only girl in the center of her adopter's universe! Lilly is a sweetheart that likes treats and bum scratchies. She excels at the sad hippo expression that melts you into a puddle of goo. She is a velvet hippo that is wonderful and amenable to being hugged, kissed on, and dressed up. She would make a wonderful best friend to a single person or a great family dog with no other pets.

Lilly is approximately 60 pounds and walks fairly well on a leash. She is crate trained and house trained.

Age: Approx. 2 years old (as of 2019)
Sex: Female
Good with Dogs: Not at this time. 
Good with Cats: No
Good with Kids: Yes
Heartworm Status: Positive. Noel's potential adopter must be willing to work with us to continue his prescribed treatment plan.

Noel is a wonderful petite lady that loves to romp and play as the days are long. She's an active little gal that beams happiness from her head to her tail! She absolutely loves treats like no ones business and who can blame her! Noel is a true delight to be around. She lives for smooches and bellyrubs in particular. And ohhh the joy of butt-scratchies! Noel is playful, gentle, and would make the greatest best friend!

Noel came to us after having been discarded like so much trash after what we can only assume was a failed backyard breeding experiment. Noel was \""used\"" and dumped off, where a good Samaritan asked for our assistance in getting her well and finding her a loving home. If you were not able to see her physical signs of having been bred - which will reduce in time- you would never know from her temperament of the trauma of her past. She walks well on a leash, rides equally well in a car, and loves to cuddle and smooch. She accepts treats gently and gratefully. Noel would make a perfect best friend, and it is therapeutic to be in her presence. You can't leave her without a big smile, which is an inverse relationship to her size- Noel is tiny! She is approximately 32 pounds soaking wet. Noel is a treasure of a velvet hippo that you just come away wanting more!

Diesel is a handsome boy with a heart of solid gold. Diesel came to us very unexpectedly when we found him chained to our front gate. We feel so bad for his previous family; how hard of a situation it must have been to abandon their family member with us. Diesel was very obviously loved; he had a rough time understanding that he was going to be our guest for the first week, and understandably was terribly heartbroken when the reality set in.

Diesel hasn't let his past define him though. Diesel is a lovely velvet hippo that has gotten along with every dog he has met in his time with us. He LOVES car rides more than anything else, and he has the best happy face with the breeze blowing in his face! He needs a little work when it comes to walking on a leash, simply because he is so exuberantly excited about his new adventures waiting just around the bend that he will give you a work out!  Diesel is crate trained, house trained is very even tempered and a well behaved boy. And yes, he is exactly as satisfying to hug on as he looks! He is 60 pounds of pure squishy.  

Are you Diesel's new family? Please read on about how to apply today!

Good with Dogs: Good with other small dogs, doesnât like big dogs. 
Good with Cats: Unknown, can test for an approved applicant, but based on temperament, we believe he would be fine.
Good with Kids: No

Phillip is extremely unsocialized, he came from a hoarding situation where he was never properly cared for and was in bad shape. He is what we classify as feral, with 20% rehab. He's definitely come out of his shell since we first rescued him. If you are looking for a dog that will be all over you and shower you with immediate love, then Phillip is not for you. He'd be a great companion dog to another small dog! He is very much a pack animal and loves the company of another pup. He runs away from you when heâs in the yard. Heâs really a quiet boy and he will have accidents when heâs scared. You can pick him up and you can pet him if heâs cornered or in a crate, but he still tends to be very jumpy. He likes to play outside and doesnât tear anything up such as toys or blankets. He will not walk on a leash therefore he cannot live in an apartment or without a fence. Your patience will pay off with this sweet boy. Remember, Phillip was failed by the human who had him. It is our goal to show him we are not here to hurt him, but to love him. He needs some TLC, time & patience. He is a project dog, who just needs to learn to trust again.

Gus is extremely unsocialized, he came from a hoarding situation where he was never properly cared for and was in horrible condition. He is what we classify as feral being about 20% rehabbed. Gus has come out of his shell somewhat since we originally rescued him. When he is out in the yard he runs away from you and barks. If you are looking for a dog that will be all over you and shower you with immediate love, then Gus is not for you. He would be a great companion dog to another small dog. He is very much a pack animal and follows wherever the herd goes, he is very playful with other small dogs. He is feral and 20% rehabbed. He will require TLC, time and patience. He does not like to be picked up, he doesnât like loud noises, he will snap and bite if he is scared. As of now he does shred toys, beds and blankets. He is jumpy when you touch him, when he allows you to touch him. Your patience is key with this boy. Remember, he was failed by the human who had him. It is our goal to show him we are not here to hurt him, but to love him. His favorite thing is treats! Please note that Gus is still having a hard time learning to use a leash therefore he would not be fit to live in an apartment. He does need a home with a fenced yard because of his current fears and tendency to bolt.

Morticia is an absolute blessing to have in your company. She weighs approximately 45lbs and is a solid wall of love and kisses. Morticia loves to cuddle, and loves to mooch chicken treats out of your pockets at every opportunity. Morticia came to us via Macon Bibb Animal Welfare after she was discovered behind a an apartment complex with her older, but still nursing puppies. Her puppies were pulled away from her at the shelter and she was left to her own devices where she found herself on the euthanasia list, where we discovered her. Morticia forgives those that left her to die, however, and would probably kiss them given the opportunity. She rides great in a car and loves to go for walks and good naturedly loves to play with toys for a few minutes before she parks herself upon your foot and asks for butt scratchies. She is very sweet and gentle and would love to give you kisses for the rest of her days!

Coco is a funny, fun-loving girl that is easy going and gentle. She's an active girl that loves to play with her tennis ball more than anything in the whole world! She is very obedient about her ball and has good manners. She knows how to sit and wait on command. She isn't a fan of small critters. She likes to go for trots around the yard and loves to play. She likes to get a serious nap after a jaunt around the yard and tussle with toys with her friends. She is a big fan of people, naps, and back scratchies, as well as chicken and milk bone cookie treats. 

Coco is a sweetheart that we think would make a wonderful family dog. Coco is kennel trained, rides great in the car, and is sweet to our vet. She has no allergies that we are aware of at this time. When she has decided you are her person, which honestly doesn't take too long, she loves you to the moon and back. She is very loyal to her people and is very sad when she is left alone for long periods of time. She loves her tennis ball very much and is a playful girl that would make a wonderful best friend that enjoys adventures, walks, hiking, and being active.

Snoopy is a goofy older gentleman. Our vet thinks Snoopy is about 10 years of age, but you would never, ever guess it when you meet him! Snoopy has lots of energy and LOVES to play and chase toys and have fun for as long as the day has hours. You may laugh at how his pictures seem to be all be at about the same angle - that's because he's quite difficult to get pictures of him where's NOT a blur of happy pinballing around the frame! He thinks he's Superman. He gets along fine with other dogs that don't mind exuberant outbursts of the zoomies and likes ear scratchies - though he literally never stops moving, so he would need a patient kind of companion. He is not aggressive towards them; just exuberant. He rides fine in the car and thinks his crate is a home away from home. Snoopy weighs in at about 20 lbs - he's quite a small dude!

Snoopy was kept on a runner outside of a trailer for his entire life that we know of. Because of his past background, he is food and treat possessive and is learning how to share. His ideal home would be one where his people understood his need to be fed separately and enjoyed his happy, exuberant energy. Because of his size and no prior health issues, we think Snoopy's approximate lifespan could go anywhere from 15-18 years - he still has a lot of time to love his folks in him!

Good with other Dogs: Yes
Heartworm Status: Negative

Noble is a good boy. He is shy at first, and needs someone that is patient and has a gentle demeanor. He warms up quickly after meeting you, and fast becomes very, very playful! He love toys of all varieties, but really goes for the squeaky ones and the ropes that he can haul on. He is good with being in his crate for periods of time; he thinks of it as his safe spot and refuge. He is a playful boy whose ears flap in the breeze when he gets very excited. He bounces like a big puppy - which isn't far off. He's a youngin'! He is protective of his food, which is something we are working on with him while he is under our care. His favorite thing in the world is to play tennis ball, endlessly if possible. Noble was taunted and teased mercilessly by children in his past life, so he is not a fan of them now. He travels well in the front seats of cars. He is confident, a clown, and very intelligent.

Yoshi would be great addition for any family! Yoshi is a big marshmallow that loves to play and give hugs. He likes to cuddle and he loves to chase toys, especially tennis balls! He is a big fan of playing with other dogs. He is eager to please his human. Yoshi is a very happy boy that loves to run and play, and is a DIE HARD tennis ball fan. He is an easy going, quick to learn boy that just wants to party and gives kisses for the rest of his days. He has learned how to open the cupboard where we keep his food - we weren't kidding when we said he was a very smart boy! 

His favorite thing in the whole world though, next to tennis balls, is food. He takes to learning commands with patient teaching very well. Yoshi is crate trained, house trained, and walks great on a leash. He is eager to look out the window when he gets to ride in a car. Yoshi is just a big lovebug that would be a wonderful best friend and adventure buddy. He would really love to be a hiking buddy or walking/jogging training partner. Please come meet Yoshi today! This boy is a chunky love and all ready to be your best friend!

Breed: Bulldog mix
Age: 12+ years old (as of 2019)
Good with Dogs: Submissive females
Good with Cats: Unknown (can test for approved applicant) We'd be surprised if Tonka had any issues with cats though. He's easy going!
Good with Kids: Yes
Heartworm Status: Negative. Tonka has undergone heartworm treatment.

Tonka's story is a sad one. Tonka was left abandoned in a house. Luckily, he was found just in time otherwise his story may have ended differently. He was left for roughly 2-3 weeks with food spread all over the floor and nothing but a 5 gallon bucket of water that was empty lying nearby. Who would abandon this boy? Luckily, movement was heard from this abandoned property, which led us to him. He is an older boy, but he is sweet, gentle and calm. He would be a great companion to anyone. He is a warrior, a survivor, a lover. We would love for him to live out the rest of his years with someone who can give him a lot of love to make up for lost time. It's hard to imagine how many years of his life he may have had filled with pain, suffering and lack of attention. Tonka can best be described as easy going, slower moving, gentle, and patient with people, even with tasks that aren't very pleasant, like cleaning one's ears or trimming his nails. Please consider adopting Tonka and changing his life! He may be an older boy, but he is not slowed down at all. He is engaged in his environment. His Clint Squint is to die for! He is a quiet, gentle old chap that loves to have his back scratches. He is as good natured as they come.

Breed: Staffordshire Bull Terrier
Age: 5 Years old (as of 2019)
Temperament: Friendly
Good with Kids: We don't see why she wouldn't be, but at this time (due to new intake), we haven't tested. She does really well with our staff.
Good With Dogs: No
Good With Cats: No
Heartworm Status: Negative 

Scarlett is a small girl in stature, but she has a big heart. She has a stumpy tail that just about hits warp speed when she gets attention all of her own- and did you know it's completely possible to fit all 40 lbs of her into your lap? We've tested extensively, and it is completely possible. She LOVES to be hugged! 

Scarlett is a zesty girl, and likes to play, whether it's with her dog friends at the rescue or with her human friends. She is best at giving kisses. She likes to be doted upon and enjoys playing with her friends at the rescue. She is one that likes to watch - sometimes we wonder if she doesn't have a herding dog in her lineage because she is so intelligent and likes to supervise proceedings at the rescue to ensure things are attended to correctly. She gives approval by doling out kisses generously, and we just love her so much! If you can't adopt at the current time, please share Miss Scarlett to the best of your abilities. We would love very much to see this special girl in a home of her very own where she's treated like the wiggle-butt princess that she is! 

Scarlett walks great on a leash and rides well in a car. She gets excited to watch out the back window as much as possible. She is used to a crate.

Breed: American Bully
Good with Kids: YES!
Good with Cats: No
Good with Dogs: Yes, although he is not a big fan of dominant male personalities or small dogs. Rocko likes to be macho! 
Age: 6 years old, as of March 2019
Sex: Male
Heartworm Status: Negative

Rocko is a sweet Staffie. He is a fun-loving, happy cannonball of sunshine that loves life and his friends. He loves kids, and most other dogs. He does not do well with cats and small animals. He does great in a home environment and really loves having a family to love on. He is a big fan of kids especially. Rocko does a happy dance on his tippy-toes like an Irish Jig at every opportunity! He loves to shower you with slobbery kisses at any time of the day or night. He is VERY friendly and loves all sorts of people! He's always ready to party. In fact, the only time weâve ever seen him pout is when the toenail clippers come out.

He is a big fan of chicken and treats of any variety. He does not have any allergies that we have found. He's a great boy and would love to snore on your couch for the remainder of his days. Rocko is crate trained, house trained, and likes to go for a ride in the car.

Rocko came to us after his former owner committed suicide and Rocko had nowhere to go. We feel terrible about his past owner and so wish we could place Rocko in a loving home where he would have stability the rest of his days!  Rocko had luxating patellas when he came to us, which basically meant that his back legsâ knees moved in and out of joint.  This meant he had a hard time getting up and down stairs prior to surgery. He had an operation on both legs to correct this, and has healed from the surgery. He has no restrictions now.

Cats: No
Temperament: Gentle, shy
Heartworm Status: Negative, Repo has been treated for heartworms successfully.

Repo is an active boy that gets on well with most dogs. He loves to play, especially with squeaky toys. He's quite friendly and thinks his best vantage point to laugh up at your face is by putting his paws on your waist and giving you kisses, once he gets to know you. He is one sweetie that think he is a macho male type, but is really a little mouse on the inside! Don't tell him that though, because he honestly thinks he's so sure of his place in the universe as the leader of the pack... until the nail trimmer comes out! Then he is instantly a chihuahua on the outside. Repo also thinks he is a Labrador Retriever - he loves to spend time playing in the water and kiddy pools at the rescue! He's not one much for tennis balls but squeaky toys definitely get his attention. He is very gentle and loves chicken treats!

Paris is the sister of Austin, also at our rescue. Austin and Paris both came from a litter of ferrel puppies. They both need an adopter that has experience with fearful feral dogs. Paris is not feral, but she is very, VERY timid about her surroundings and thrives on routine and baby talk.  Paris and Austin both respond well to training, but just need the time and investment of love that a true family environment can provide. They are both very intelligent dogs that need a serious injection of TLC. They respond well to routines and training.

Kermit sadly was neglected and confined to a small cage, which prevented his legs from developing correctly. In turn, he does not walk like other dogs. He is the sweetest boy and deserves a great family. He loves bellyrubs above all else. He also really appreciates being put on a leash and walked for as long as his legs will let him...and then more bellyrubs. This is actually his preferred position, hence his crazy happy photos! He would make a great couch potato kind of dog, perfect family dog. He is very good natured and a jovial kind of dog that has no idea he is any kind of different. He loves to go for short jaunts and explore new places. He is overall a very happy boy and very eager to please. He walks well on a leash and rides great in the car.

Good with Cats: Unknown, can test for an approved applicant.

Heartworm Status: Negative 

Jordyn came to us as an unclaimed stray via Macon-Bibb Animal Welfare, the county animal control. We can't understand why no one ever came looking for her, because Jordyn is a lover! Jordyn has the most adorable underbite known to man. She loves to play and has plenty of puppy energy to spare! She is a ray of sunshine, and it's impossible to meet Jordyn, interact with her, and not walk away with a similar goofy smile. Jordyn is a doll, and a tiny one at that. She is approximately 35 pounds in weight. 

Jordyn walks well on a leash and enjoys a healthy jaunt around the premises.  She is a very active girl that is always on the go and has places to be! You will never be bored with Jordyn around. She enjoys her afternoon naps and her afternoon playtime, which usually includes a well loved tennis ball. Jordyn loves toys and has dog friends at the rescue that she gets along well with that tolerate her puppy energy and antics stoically. Her canine companions would need to also be willing to put up with her energy levels. Jordyn is a great girl that is eager to please and show you how cool the world is! She would make a great best friend.

Jimmy is a very smart dog and would do well with a family that loves to adventure and spend time with him. He knows basic commands like sit, stay, back up, etc. He has thrived on being taught manners, and we think he would do well in any training that an owner would wish to put him through. He listens very well and is a very intelligent, thoughtful boy. Jimmy is dominant and to date has not liked other dogs at our rescue. At this time, we recommend him being the only dog. His ideal owner would be one that shows Jimmy how to act through example and is a leader in his or her own home. 

Jimmy enjoys having his back scratched, going for walks, and cuddling up on the comfiest blankets we have. He is a sweetheart that needs someone that can appreciate his brainpower as well as his handsome good looks. He is so squishy and sweet, and gives the best hugs. He is a big fan of chicken and does great on a leash. He is crate trained and rides well in a car. He is a great boy that enjoys being taught new things. Jimmy has lots of love to give!

Chief is a 3 year old, neutered-male Boxer mix.  
This sweet boy is still young, so he will benefit from some obedience training.  A fenced yard would be a nice place for Chief to have some freedom outdoors.  Chief would do best in a home with older children. 
We are just getting to know him, so check back for more updates on this handsome guy.  
Chiefâs adoption fee is $100.00.  That includes neuter, vaccinations, heartworm test (negative), flea and heartworm prevention, deworming, microchip (plus registration) and a 30 day pet insurance policy offer. 
** You can meet CHIEF on Adoption nights, which are held every Friday from 4-6pm at our office located at 169 E Jefferson Street, Franklin, Indiana 46131.
**If you are interested in giving CHIEF a loving forever home, please submit an adoption application from our website www.petelves.com.   Email petelvesrescue@gmail.com with any questions.

We are Hoss and Abbigale and we come as a pair of cuties! Together we weigh about 15 pounds, and around 6 years old. We do everything together like sit on your lap and sleep in our kennel. We do fine with other dogs, but we are not really interested in playing with them. We sleep quietly in our kennel and have had no accidents in there. The shelter environment and our foster home is new to us so we are a little timid. It took us a few hours before we warmed up to our foster family. For the most part we do a good job of using puppy pads. I Hoss (white and brown) do a good job on going outside on a leash, Abbigale (brown) prefers not to go outside. We would be best with older children (10+) as we are small and timid. It is also good to know that I (Hoss) have a pin in one of my front legs. It does not prevent me from running/jumping or having fun. We are both sweet and cuddly, we just need a family to call our own. We hope you will come and meet us on Saturday!

Iâm Reagan. I used to live my life on a chain and could never go in the house. I've had a lot of litters of puppies in my day. I was recently seized from a house by these nice animal control officers. They found out that I was heartworm positive and I also need a dental cleaning. But now I love the air conditioning and don't want to stay outside longer than I have to go to the bathroom. Which I normally do outside! I'm sweet as can be and I love cats and children. I walked a little bow-legged and would really benefit from joint supplements. Belly rubs are my favorite!

Note: I am heartworm positive because I never got the preventative in my prior home.  Iâll be treated and then Iâll just need 30 days of low activity to heal.

Iâm loving my life in my foster home right now! I get free range of the house because I seem to be fully house trained and I crate well when told to! I know basic commands like sit, down, and shake with both my paws. My favorite activity is laying in bed with my foster mom cause I love to snuggle so much! I also double as her body guard. I might be 9 y/o but that doesnât slow my long legs down when my foster family goes out to do activities. When you come to meet me ignore how shy I might seem because when you get me home I will be the most bestest doggo ever! 

Note:  In my prior home I didn't like it when people would \""play fight\"" because that upset me and made me bite.  If I felt like someone was being hurt, I was going to protect that person.  So if you can work with me on this, I will be pretty easy to get along with otherwise.

Let me tell you a bit about me... I'm living in a foster home now with three other dogs and no kids or cats.

I am a young and playful small dog with not too many cares in the world. I'm working on the potty training currently, but  the puppy pads are working great for me. I haven't done a lot of leash walking yet, I'm not super fond of it. I can get a bit persistent and riled up at times, I slept in the crate last night and although it's not my favorite place to be, I settle down after a bit. I have only been here for about a week and I am learning new dog skills every day. Its not that I don't like it here, but am looking for my forever family, a place to call home permanently! Ask about me or fill out the application! I am about a year old and 8lbs.

Aretha is a mover. Sheâs either playing or sleeping. She shares well with others and will cuddle the small puppies. She is learning to sit and sleeps well through the night. We are getting very good at going outside but we still have the occasional accident.

Iâm a spunky little snuggle bug looking for my forever people. I love playing with other dogs but if you donât have another dog for me to play with, thatâs fine too because I just want to be your very best friend! I love being around my people and will follow you wherever you go! Whether thatâs on a walk or just hanging out on the couch, I just want to keep you company! 
I appear house and crate trained and have had ZERO accidents in my foster home! I also sleep quietly in my crate at night. Sometimes I bark for a minute or two when I first go into my crate but I settle down quickly if you just leave me be. 
Iâm very food motivated which means I can learn new things pretty quickly as long as youâre offering a treat! So far Iâve mastered âsitâ and âdownâ! My foster parents say Iâm pretty smart!
If you have room in your life for a fun little adventure buddy, Iâd love to meet you!

Note:  I am heartworm positive, so that means I need to have low activity until my treatment and 30 days of low activity after my treatment.  I can still be adopted though!

Note: I do have a condition called âcherry eyeâ. Cherry eye is a disorder of the nictitating membrane (NM), also called the third eyelid. Cherry eye is most often seen in young dogs under the age of two. In many species, the third eyelid plays an essential role in vision by supplying oxygen and nutrients to the eye via tear production. If left untreated, tear production may stop. This can be treated with a simple surgery.  She's getting that surgery on 9/17 along with her spay as well.

Since they had me come out of my crate, they've been working with me a little more every day and they tell me how proud of me they are for making progress every day. I've been with my foster family for about a month now and I've gotten much more comfortable with them. I love to follow my foster mom around the house everywhere she goes. I wag my tail and do my happy dance when I see my foster family now. I went from being scared of them, to loving getting pets and treats from them. I love treats! I hardly ever run into my crate when they are home now, because I enjoy being out in the house with my foster fam. I do great with going potty outside in my little puppy pen. I stay in a crate when my humans leave the house and at bedtime. I have 3 human siblings (ages 7-11) in my foster family and 2 canine siblings that are both close to my size. I have done well with my human siblings because they are very calm and patient with me. I don't think I would like to be with young kids that don't know how to be patient and calm with me and give me my space to build up trust with them. I now love playing with dog toys and chasing balls. I love running around and playing with my 2 year old canine brother.  I'm not a big fan of my older canine foster brother though. I have come a long way during my time in my foster home, so although I'll have a transition period to go through in my new home, I know I would blossom with having a fur-ever family. I would love a family that understands that I will need time and patience to build up trust and know that they are good and love me and help me to understand that the world isn't so scary. Will you be that family?

Im Miss Alma. I'm a tiny lady looking for a place to chill to call my furever home. I came from a hoarding home in SC and so I'm learning to cuddle with my foster mama and explore the home. I get along with other dogs but I get grumpy about my space and prefer to sleep solo. My hobbies include eating and napping on very plush bedding. I am maybe 5lb but I sure do enjoy my canned dinners and my foster mama even warms them up for me because my precious eyes convince her I require that. These hoomans that cater to me make me get up and walk around. I'll do best with a home with older kids that understand to give me space. I haven't been cat tested but by my chill level I don't see it even phasing me. 
And I think Iâm about 7 years old, but Iâm not sure. I will need a dental and to be on canned food only.

My name is Zeus and Iâm a special boy, according to my foster mom. I have come a long way in my foster home in learning how to \""dog\"".  I started life in a home that hoarded dogs, so I didn't get the best care and the love and attention I needed.  Because of this situation, I was defensive and a bite risk to start.  I like it when you get down on my level and don't tower over me.  You are big and I am very small, so you look like a giant coming at me.  

I have found that I like pillows and they give me security, in that I can hide in them if I want to.  I also am treat motivated (fish based treats are my favorite), so that will be a good way to continue my training. Once Iâm comfortable with you, I love to snuggle close and get belly rubs. I do love to give kisses but I can get a little overboard!

I am working on leash skills and not being so scared with quick movements, loud sounds, and going through doorways.  I like to walk with a harness on and I am learning that I should do my potty business outside. While I am learning, I do understand about potty pads inside. 

I like having a K9 companion, but I would not do well with cats in my forever home.  If you are willing to work with me, I know I could be a great dog for you.

Iâm a small thing at just 10lbs! 

I was just rescued about a month ago from a hoarding situation so a majority of the world makes me quite nervous but Iâm slowly settling into my foster home. 

I love being outside and just laying out on the porch. Think quick about taking me for a walk cause leashes are scary for now. 

Iâm curious about my foster humans. Iâll go up and sniff and lick them when they arenât noticing but if they try to touch me I scurry off cause Iâm not ready for that much attention just yet. So no small humans for me because if they donât understand the space I need right now I will bite them. 

There are 5 other dogs living with me. The first couple of days I growled when they came near my personal space but we are growing on each other though I would probably do best either as the only dog or just co-habitating with a dog that doesnât want to play.  

Iâm also heartworm positive. Right now Iâm taking my meds before my treatment gets scheduled so Iâll need the low activity life I already prefer until my treatment date and 30 days after.

I get along fine with other dogs as long as they aren't annoying me by constantly getting in my personal space, so another older guy or gal like me would be ideal. I'd also prefer older kids as I don't care to be climbed on or have my fluffy tail pulled. I like to be in the presence of my humans & sleeping in their room. I like to roam the house during the day & to snooze on the couch. If you're not looking, I'll be sure to steal any food that I'm able to reach (trash included). I'm a great alert dog, making sure my humans know when unauthorized people or animals come near the house. I'm a good boy. I also love being groomed (brushed, bathed, hairdryer, etc.) although I may need to be muzzled when trimming my nails. If you scratch my butt, I'll never leave you alone.

I was born in March and I am doing so well with crate training.  I sleep in my crate overnight and don't have any accidents (a whole 8 hours).  As far as potty training in my foster home, that is a work in progress, but I am doing very well. I'm a little slow to trust, but I warm up pretty quick.

She does great with the other dogs (especially loves bigger dogs) and loves to play with them.

I am pretty old and tired, my eyes and ears are not working so well these days. My brother and I ended up with the fine people at the Old Dominion Humane Society after our elderly owner passed way. My brother was a little younger and lucky enough to get adopted, I miss him but I am happy for him. Like most older gentlemen I have some hair loss but with grooming I am looking much better. I spend most of my day sleeping and resting, I sleep quietly in my kennel at night and I have been doing really well about doing my business outside. I do fine with other dogs as long as they do not keep me from napping. I walk on a leash well outside but really struggle with stairs. I think this is because of my poor eyesight. Good news is I only weigh about 10 pounds so I am not heavy to carry. I get along with everyone and enjoy getting pets, oh and kids are great too! I know I might be as cute as some of the young pups and yes I am in the later chapters of my life but I am willing to give you every ounce of love I have left. If you are looking for a sweet quiet older gentlemen to warm your lap in the coming months then I am your guy. Please stop by to see me even if it is just for a short visit.  
 
Thanks,

Wes

Well, that's my real name, but my friends call me Ray Ray or little bit around here. I'm new to this household and I've only been here a few days, but I settled right in! They say I'm very well tempered and loveable (what?? people think they can talk about me while I'm in the room and I'm not gonna hear them?). I'm kind of a snuggle bug if I was bigger I'd be a great spooning partner. Especially burried in a fuzzy blanket! The other dogs here are just fine with me too, sometimes they get a bit aggressive with playtime, but I can hold my own. I'm being treated for flea bites currently and I'm hoping my hair fills in as time goes on. Those little bugs really bother me. I'm small, but don't let that fool you, I LOVE to eat! Dinner time is my favorite and I try to show it with excitement and love! I pretty much do my business outside, but I don't like the rain so I have had a couple of accidents in the hallway (hey but at least they're small). Car rides are cool, it's a big world out there to see! I'm ok with the leash, but I'd rather just cruise around freely. The other dogs go a hootin' and hollering about the crate, but I don't mind it, seems like a safe place for me! This place has a few dogs, I haven't seen a kid or a cat yet, but I think from what I've heard I'll do fine with them. I like it here ok, but sure would love a place to call my own and be part of a forever family! Ask about me, I'm hoping to get an application soon!I am about 3 years old and about 15lbs.

Note: My leg has been bothering me and my x-rays have been done.  We are awaiting the results,  I am hoping itâs just arthritis and nothing worse.

He loves to play, but he has a hard time picking up social cues from other dogs. He can be too rough with small dogs, so those are a no for him. If you have a very playful dog, Ajax would be a good playmate, but he doesn't know when to stop. Ajax rides well in the car and is crate trained. He is looking for a dog savy family that can help teach him not to be mouthy. No small kids for this guy! Sometimes he can even leave marks! Ouch! He is such a ham, though! Ajax LOVES going hiking and playing in the water. Do you have what it takes to train him?

Iâm a small fellow at just 18lb but Iâm a year old so no growing for me! 

What do I want the most? A big spoon. I want some humans that I can snuggle with all night kinda like I am a teddy bear. Hey if you want to nickname me Teddy I wouldnât even mind! 

Iâd also like some toys. Fluffier the better. Oh and some siblings to play with... 2-legged or 4... doesnât matter! 

And I want breakfast for breakfast lunch and dinner. Yeah eggs... theyâre yummy. I mean bacon is too... but eggs I like. 

Itâs ok if you come with a crate. Iâm good in the crate! Now.... Iâm still working on mastering my potty skills but if I had to guess you were in diapers at 1 too! 

Iâm working on resource guarding, not jumping 6 foot fences, and getting along with dogs smaller than me (little man syndrome).  Iâd be great for an only dog house if thatâs your situation.

So what do you say... we snuggling tonight?

Most importantly, Butterscotch has a fantastic temperament. She's a happy, easy-going, and curious pup who gets along with everyone. She's met small dogs and big ones and been friendly and appropriate with them all. She plays constantly with her foster brother and would love a home with another dog to play with. However, she's pretty independent and confident, so she'd probably be fine as an only dog too! She is still a puppy, obviously, and gets zoomies sometimes, so a fenced yard would also be great, but she'd be fine with lots of walks, runs, and play time!

Butterscotch has spent time with a toddler and really enjoyed him! She gve him kisses and enjoyed playing fetch. She also loves to play in water -- puddles, the hose, or the beach! She has been kayaking and loved it.

While she's a very curious, active, and playful dog, Butterscotch also likes to cuddle and is very affectionate. She's been great with all the strangers she's met, on walks and in the house.

He came from a shelter in Gallia and is sweet and spunky and loves to play with other pups. He is almost housebroken! And we expect that to be finished up once he is neutered. He has a great deal of energy and loves to play with his small foster sibling pups, run around the yard, and go for walks. He can be shy at first but quickly warms up. He is crate trained, not yet cat-tested, and very happy when people wake up in the morning! Right now Harvey is being treated for Lyme, Ehrlichia and hair loss. He is on his way to a happy healthy life and is looking for that perfect someone for his life! His foster says this... \"" he is the cutest, goofiest, baldy bean and we adore him!\"

He was pulled from a south Georgia animal shelter. He had been shot and was having trouble walking. We took him to a specialist that decided it was unsafe to remove the bullets because they were too close to his spinal cord. He is a happy, goofy boy that needs a home to call his own. His back legs are weak and he needs some Physical Therapy to build some strength in his back legs. He has shown that he loves other dogs and LOVES to play. When first introduced, he will lunge because of his back leg issues. He is not aggressive at all.We do not have a shelter facility and our pets are housed in foster homes, vet clinics and local boarding facilities.

He was a favorite of the staff and volunteers at the shelter but was due to be euthanized due to lack of space. A determined volunteer began reaching out to local rescue groups to save his life and my licensed rescue Hands to Paws in Augusta responded and gave him his freedom ride. Gregor is quite the character and has such a great, playful personality. Heâs currently being boarded at a local kennel an has been there for several months, getting wonderful care there but itâs time for this special boy to have a home of his own!

Heâs affectionate, friendly, loving, loves people and needs to be the only dog in the household. He's good with kids but due to his size and strength it would be best for the kids to be older - no small children. Wonât you consider giving this special boy his permanent soft place to fall? He will bring you so much love and joy. He's got such a great personalty and is a sweet soul. He's had a rough start in life and deserves a loving home. Could it be you? Until his forever home is found we are also looking for a foster home for Gregor - it's a great way to see if he would be a good match for your family and it gives him a chance to be in a home and out of boarding for a while, so please consider fostering sweet Gregor if adopting is not an option right now! There's no cost for fostering - it just requires love and TLC! Please contact me for details about either fostering or adopting this very special soul!

That doesnât stop this handsome hunk from enjoying life! He loves to go for rides. Is learning to walk on a leash but still pulls so a harness is a must. His nose knows who and where everyone and everything (especially food) is. Lol. He does counter surf and gets in garbage if you leave him for long periods of time. He is very smart and has figured out how to open the kitchen cabinets. 

Waylon never meets a stranger, loves everyone he meets. He would love a quiet home where his humans are home a lot or retired and can spend time teaching him obedience and some touch signals for commands. 

Waylon is about 8 yrs old, neutered and up to date on vaccines. He is currently on a diet. Still needs to lose about 20 lbs or more but is doing well with it so far!! Waylon is housebroken, good with dogs and cats. Children over 12 yrs old please. He is located in Georgia.

Mason is a quirky guy. He is a 50 pound husky with a lapdog mentality. He will love you unconditionally and be your best friend. He loves to give kisses and is starting to do pretty well at the sit command. He plays hard and naps even harder. He does great at night, He has slept in both his bed, at the base of the bed, and up in bed with people. It just depends on his mood that night. He loves bones and jerky treats are his favorite. He likes his dinner wet, so we put some wet food on top of his dry food. He is also doing pretty good on a leash. We have been working with him and are seeing improvement. He does get excited when he sees other dogs. He will continue to be trained to be focused while walking, but overall does pretty well on a leash. He will need someone who has time to spend with him during the day or another dog to help keep him company when nobody is home since he does get very anxious being home alone. Fireworks and loud noises don't scare him however. We will send him with his crate, treats, a few toys, his harness, and his leash. His breed is known for high energy and needing a lot of exercise. He is doing great in his foster home. He loves kids and has even met and done well with cats.

HI, I'M DIEGO! DO YOU LOVE TO SNUGGLE AND PLAY? ME TOO!

It seems this sweet boy spent the beginning of his life living outdoors at the end of a chain. Oh, how Diego has blossomed in foster care! He adores people of all ages, including children, and and absolutely craves attention. He may be a little too enthusiastic for small children, so care will need to be taken in that regard. Diego hasn't gotten the memo that he's larger than your average lap dog, as he loves to get as close as possible to snuggle and offer pittie kisses.

This very smart pup will sit, shake, down and rollover on command; we're still working on 'stay' and 'come.' His leash manners could use some polishing, although a proper harness and additional training will be beneficial. Diego has excellent car manners and will often nod off in the passenger seat. Toys rock his world and this silly guy is always ready to romp and play. He'll chase a ball all day long but hasn't gotten the hang of returning it to you just yet. While Diego shares nicely with humans, he's not inclined to share toys, treats or food with other dogs and may act out in an aggressive manner. He's housebroken and crate trained in foster care and may just need a refresher course in his new home, as he gets the hang of a new routine.

Diego does not do well with dogs who make him feel challenged or threatened. He needs to be your one and only. He's also not a fan of kitties and there can be no cats in his home. If you can offer Diego the exercise, playtime and loving care he craves, he's ready to make your acquaintance. A fenced yard is would be ideal. He's had some hard knocks in life, but Diego has shaken off the dust and is ready for his happily-ever-after to begin.

Even though his previous owners threw him out of a car window, he has improved by leaps & bounds! He loves people, toys, and everything about his new life.

Baxter is thriving in his foster home and is the perfect little companion. He is very loyal to his people and super affectionate. He loves to sit in your lap and adores belly rubs. He has fun playing fetch with his favorite toy and going on daily walks. Baxter would do well as an only pet or with a friend â he loves everyone!  He is housebroken.

Unfortunately, Baxter was heartworm positive, but he started his treatment and is on his way to a healthy new life. Baxter will be available for adoption after completing his heartworm treatment (early Oct). We are currently taking applications so he can go straight to his new home when ready. Baxter is a foster-to-adopt candidate if you are located in the Greensboro, NC area.

If you are interested in adopting this dog, contact h2hadoptions@gmail.com. An all adult home with a fenced yard (fence must be attached to the home) is required to adopt from Hart-2-Heart Rescue.

There is an application process and adoption fee. We are an all-volunteer organization, and in addition to saving dogs, we have other responsibilities, so we appreciate your patience and understanding during this process. Response time can take up to 5 business days.

She has a high prey drive and would not do well with cats either. Sheâs a working dog, so space to run and tasks to do would be great for her. She would be best as an only dog and is a huge lover with people, once she starts to trust them. 

She was rescued from Halo a few years back. The vet advised her to put her down if she can't find a way to make it work in the home, but sheâs a healthy dog around 5 years old that just needs to be in a home with someone who can love her and show her thatâs the world isnât so bad, and with someone who can help her overcome her trust issues. We definitely do not believe she deserves to lose her life over her lack of trust. 

Jasmine has been nothing but a total sweetheart with humans; we know that with the right home and a good amount of patience, she can be the best dog and make someone really happy!"

Shiloh was completely feral when he arrived with Tier Haven from Hazard, Kentucky. He clearly had never been handled prior to this time and we are unaware of the circumstances surrounding his first few months.

Shiloh still has a very long way to go in trusting people. He has zero confidence in himself or the world around him resulting in a very timid and shy dog. Shiloh has no fear aggression and has never lashed out but is going to require a home with the patience to work with him to overcome his past. Shiloh does really well with people from a distance of about 5-7 feet and will linger on the outskirts of interactions but doesn't know what to do when the attention is turned to him. Shiloh will come up and nudge from behind seeking attention but does best when there isn't a big fuss made about it. He has a desire to be around people but is still so unsure of him.

Shiloh does great with other dogs and really relies on them for social cues. He was running with another dog - Bentley - who we suspect is his brother. Shiloh was definitely the follower and has stayed true to that role. He does great with other dogs and has learned how to navigate play groups really well. He would really benefit from having another dog or group of dogs in a home to show him the ropes and help him overcome his fears.

A volunteer reached out to us about Shiloh within minutes of when he was scheduled to be euthanized - there was certainly a large hand guiding him to safety and we hope to see him fulfill his potential with a loving home. 

If you have a place in your heart and home for this sweet young boy please email tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application."

My name is Lt. Dan and I am a year old mixed breed dog. We think I might be an Australian Cattle Dog mix or something, but one thing is for sure: I'm 100% handsome! I'm even more handsome with three legs! Your eyes do not deceive you: I am tripawed and a lucky boy. I am awesome with other dogs but my foster mom says I'm not that great with cats because oh boy do I like to chase them. I'm pretty food motivated and will take all of the snacks you'll give me... but I need a new family to help me watch my figure because of my disability.

Truth be told, I did not have the best start in life. I was dumped on the side of a road where I searched for my family and had to fend for myself. While looking for my family I was hit by a car. I was scared and lonely and was hurt really bad. I was so scared of people and it took three big scary men to catch me. They brought me to a hospital where I met my foster mom. She gave me pain medication and advocated for me. This is where the amazing Mel said foster mom could bring me into the rescue and make me better. They amputated my leg and my foster mom slowly gained my trust as I healed. As you can imagine I am still very scared around new people and strangers. I need my new family to come meet me a few times before I can go home with them. It would also be great if my new family has worked with a fearful dog before. I am getting better with trusting my foster mom about strangers and ignoring them. I love playing with my foster brothers and sisters and can play all day. I have foster kitties in the house that I will chase if they run. I am going to go play with my foster siblings now and my foster mom will tell you more.

Lt. Dan is up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and on flea, tick and heartworm prevention monthly. He LOVES playing with other dogs and gets along with dogs of all sizes. He can live with dog savvy cats. Lt. Dan is fearful of new people and his adopter with be required to come to New Jersey a few times to meet him and spend some time with him before he can go to his new home. His adopters will also need to have experience with fearful dogs and will need to work with a positive reinforcement trainer. Once he learns to trust you, Lt. Dan will cuddle with you all day if you let him. He is a medium energy dog who just wants to be with his person. He will gladly occupy you on a long walk or cuddle on the couch all day with you. Because he had his leg amputated his adopters will need to be vigilant about his diet, weight and keep him exercised. Lt. Dan has had a rough beginning but with love and dedication he can overcome his past and be a loving member of a family. Could that be you?

SOHO is a 501c3 public charity focusing on rescuing herding dogs in crisis on the East Coast. Your pets will need to be up to date on vaccinations and heartworm preventative in order to be considered for adoption. Lt. Dan does have some additional adoption requirements: his foster mom would like a potential adopter to come and visit Lt. Dan a few times before taking him home in order to help him bond to his new family. Please note that Lt. Dan is located in HIGHLAND LAKES, NEW JERSEY."

Our sweet little baby Assana .

Yes she looks adorable ...but fear is in her eyes .

Her owner passed away and clearly he did not care for his dogs . No vetting, no decent food and they don't know what love is .

9 dogs were on the property . We took 5 in and ALL of them are shaking over their body .

Assana bites the first leash over so we put stronger ones and to keep her safe we put 2 on .

She is cornered and surrenders . She lays on her back and I give her slowly some belly rubs... she is confused ...because she likes this .

This poor baby needs a good person who understands what abuse and neglect can do to a dog . She needs somebody with patience and time to give .

We have seen so many blooming open and it's wonderful how adopters and their dogs come together .

It would be nice if somebody can give her her golden basket where she feels safe and loved .

Assana is 3 years old , is ok with other dogs but also a little bit afraid sometimes and is not a fan of cats .

This little beauty is located in Huntington NY .

To become her new family please apply today by filling in the adoption application to find on our website www.a-teameliterescuedogs.com or email us and we send you one

I am a true survivor!!  I survived a very bad Hurricane named Superstorm Sandy that destroyed the shelter I was at! I was so very scared, especially when I first came to New York Bully Crew. It was a horrible storm. Today I am a lot better but I do need a strong experienced pack leader owner to help guide me and make me feel secure. I still tend to get nervous around some people-the stress and trauma I went through from that Hurricane and all the scary things afterwards that went along with it made me a bit insecure. Can you help me by being my leader?? Help me regain my confidence again? I am 8 years old and do ok with  other calm balanced dogs. They make me not so scared when they are near me. I would love a family to help me and my rescue family says I deserve to be treated like a Princess after all I've been through. Please go to www.nybullycrew.org and fill out the application for me. I'm waiting all this time for you!! I do hope you come for me soon!! Thank you!"

Chief is a 3 year old, neutered-male Boxer mix.  
This sweet boy is still young, so he will benefit from some obedience training.  A fenced yard would be a nice place for Chief to have some freedom outdoors.  Chief would do best in a home with older children. 
We are just getting to know him, so check back for more updates on this handsome guy.  
Chiefâs adoption fee is $100.00.  That includes neuter, vaccinations, heartworm test (negative), flea and heartworm prevention, deworming, microchip (plus registration) and a 30 day pet insurance policy offer. 
** You can meet CHIEF on Adoption nights, which are held every Friday from 4-6pm at our office located at 169 E Jefferson Street, Franklin, Indiana 46131.
**If you are interested in giving CHIEF a loving forever home, please submit an adoption application from our website www.petelves.com.   Email petelvesrescue@gmail.com with any questions.

Thankfully there is a local ordinance that requires owners to bring them inside when the temperature is extremely cold or hot here. He is between 5 and 6 years old and has lived his entire life on a chain. Since the shelter was full, we had to agree to pull him right away, as they have no choice but to euthanize for space when they get owner surrenders. He is in need of a foster or forever home in the Indianapolis area, where we can provide the needed medical care for him. ear is very easy going, and gentle, and gets along well with other dogs. He is untested with cats.  He is very easy going, and seems to like all people.  He rides fine in a vehicle too. He does not pull on a leash.  He is very sweet and a little timid. He has been groomed, had a biopsy done on some bumps on his back that were the result of flea dermatitis we found out, and is undergoing heartworm treatment.  His fly strikes have healed nicely. If you would like to help Bear, please complete a foster or adoption application on our website, www.igpr.org. Bear is located in Indianapolis, Indiana.

We recommend obedience training for all newly adopted pyrs, to help you create a special bond with you and your new friend, and so you have a well behaved canine. Great Pyrenees are willing to learn, but are not as eager to comply with commands as much as other breeds. They are bred to be independent thinkers. Applicants must be over 25, own their own home and all children in household must be over 6 years old. Your resident pets must be up to date on vaccines, sterilized, you must have a good history of vet care for them, and you must have used heartworm preventative year round for your dogs. 


Bear will be placed as an inside pet with outside privileges. You MUST have a securely fenced yard accessible from your home. Invisible fencing does not work with this breed and they will take the shock for the freedom.  Great Pyrenees are bred to roam and will create their own territory if not secured, which can led to them being lost, hit by vehicles or shot by people who see them as a threat. The breed is not a good off leash dog, and cannot be trusted to not run away.  A Great Pyrenees off leash is a \"" DisAPyr.\"" 

If you are interested in adopting or fostering, please complete the appropriate application on our website, www.igpr.org under the Adopt tab. 

All of our dogs marked as needing foster homes are also available for adoption.  If a dog is listed on this site, it is available.  No need to contact us to see if it is,  We do require you  complete the adoption application prior to meeting a dog.

We also offer a foster to adopt program. You foster the dog, and have first right of refusal on them if an approved application is submitted for them. 

In fostering a dog, the dog comes to you fully vetted. and groomed. You provide good quality food, grooming, and we provide the heartworm preventative and medical care, if needed* .(*Based on approval from IGPR.)

Adoption fee is $350"

Hi my name is Noodle, a silly name for a silly boy! I'm A  70 lb 3 to 4 year old boxer  mix and I'm located in Ipswich MA. I'm very shy at first meeting but once I warm up I'm your bestest friend ever! I'm potty trained and crate trained but I don't like being locked away from my people. I love to go on long walks and could probably become a running buddy but I also like to snuggle in on the couch or on your bed but only if you promise to share your blankets!  I do like to play ball but generally only have a few minute attention span for that. I don't like to be left home alone so a person who is home a lot would be my perfect match unless you can take me everywhere with you! I'd LOVE that! I'm a super good boy in the car. I love other dogs, but I need a slow intro because I like to jump on them and for some reason they don't think that's a very good greeting weird huh? I don't get it. 
I was found as a stray and very skinny so now that I have food I don't like to share it and I need to eat in peace, for that reason my foster mom says no kiddos Under 12 for me. Also no cats or other small animals, she says that they don't make good snacks but I don't believe her. I'm a very smart and super food motivated so I will learn quickly. I would benefit from some training but all in all I'm a great catch! If it sounds like you'd be a good fit for me contact my buddy Mary Lou at Maryloumaria@yahoo.com 
A note from my foster mom,
 Noodle needs a very committed person who is willing to give him the time he needs to fully come out of his shell. It took about six weeks in foster care to see the completely silly and awesome dog he truly is!  He went from not touching a toy to now carrying his favorite one with him wherever he goes!!

Demi was rescued by one of our team members from the streets of Jackson one freezing cold night in November.  She was with her chihuahua buddy, Rumor, who was adopted months ago.  Demi is about 3 years old.  She is a very outgoing, loving, loyal dog.  She is the perfect size, weighing only 35-40 lbs.  Demi wants nothing more than to get out of a kennel and into a home, whether it be a temporary foster home or forever family. This girl loves the water and to be outside in the grass.  She rolls around on her back in the grass and wants belly rubs.  Demi also loves toys and to play with other dogs her size, preferably males.  She can be somewhat of a diva around larger female dogs.  Demi is not doing well at our kennel facility.  She is very stressed and paces back and forth.  She just wants a person.  Her own person to love on her and dote on her.  She deserves attention and love.  We've done alot of research as to what Demi's breed might be, and we've believe she is Jack Russell Terrier/Basenji mix.  She is spayed, up to date with all vet care, and has even completed heartworm treatment.  She is so ready to find her forever family.  If you would like to meet Demi to see if she is a good match for your family,  please fill out the online adoption application at www.rrofms.org/adoption-application.

Over 3,500 days since the hurricane cracked the skies open and drove the sea right into town. If you have to ask which hurricane, well, then you probably aren't from around here. Katrina made landfall at Waveland, MS, a small town of 7,000 just an hour east of New Orleans, on August 29, 2005, and you'd be hard-pressed to find any of God's good creatures in Waveland that don't remember. Destin and Sparky remember.



Chaos is too simple of a word to convey what that time was like, but it's the closest thing we've got. Fortunately, there were a few clear minds that day, including Doll Stanley and In Defense of Animals. The organization recognized the doom bearing down on animals in the region, petitioning courts to release captured animals in the pound. Destin was one such animal, languishing in the pound as the storm bore down on the Gulf Coast. At the 11th hour, a judge granted the request, forcing animal control to release the animals to safety. When they reached Destin, the water was already up to her neck. Destin and 34 other animals were rescued that night, but, sadly, thousands more souls lost their lives all along the coast. Destin and Sparky, who was discovered after the storm, were some of the lucky ones.



A number of animal rescue facilities went to work in the aftermath of Katrina, and ARF was one of the organizations born from the rubble. The 35 dogs from Waveland made the trip north to Jackson, and a few more groups soon followed. Destin and Sparky were placed together in their new home, and quickly became inseparable, sharing a bond that few of us can scarcely imagine. Yet over 3,500 days after the storm arrived, these two remain with ARF. Every one of the other 35 dogs has moved on, either adopted to a wonderful home or crossing the rainbow bridge. We've twice attempted to adopt Sparky individually, but both dogs immediately grew depressed and stopped eating. Their bond is unique and irreplaceable, and so even though we know how challenging it is to adopt two older dogs, we know that they need to be together. They are sweet and spunky, despite their advanced age. But the wisdom in their eyes is surely enough reward for providing a forever home.



Katrina had an impact that still reverberates throughout the region. As we think of it, we still mourn for those that have been lost. Yet we also recognize the events that catalyzed the creation of ARF, and are reminded of our mission. If you can't adopt Destin and Sparky today, then please continue joining us in this mission. Stop by sometime to walk these wonderful dogs. The lifeblood of this organization is our supporters, and we're grateful every day that you've helped us make it this far.

I have been patiently waiting for a chance to prove it to my forever family. I have had some pretty rough experiences. These are the parts of my life that I have chosen to forget, but people see them all over my body. Good fortune came my way when Eleventh Hour Rescue saved me from the streets of Jersey City. They cleaned me up and made sure I was fully recovered.

  

 I am easy to take care of with a very short coat that needs occasional brushing mostly because I love it. I don't like to walk very far, but exercise is as important for my mind as it is for my body. I like to walk for about 15 minutes. I am built for comfort not for speed. I like to play with a jolly ball and to spend time outside sniffing around. I love to sit on a bench with a kissable human. I am a little shy with new people and I don't like loud noises. I will let you know I am unhappy about it by heading back indoors.

  

 A greeting from me means hoisting my \""low to the ground\"" little body up as close as I can get and giving lots of kisses. When it is time for you to go I will head for my comfy bed and settle in with a toy and a Nylabone to chew. I learned to sleep in my crate, too. I may need a little time to get used to sleeping in a crate again after having a kennel run for a while, but I am a smart boy!

  

 Here are some obedience things I know: sit, down, stay, walking nicely on a leash with very little pulling.

Duke is estimated around 15 months of age. Duke came to us from a rural area of Kentucky where he had been living on a farm but was surrendered to the shelter for chasing livestock. Duke doesn't have much herding sense and is certainly not the best farm dog but he has lots of love to give. 

Duke is the definition of a big baby - he enjoys cuddles, butt scratches, and always being nearby for lovings. Duke is an enthusiastic boy who doesn't have a good concept of personal space therefore he is thrilled to be the over-sized lap dog you didn't know you needed. Duke does well when introduced to new people in public and introduced properly to visitors. He has been around children 7 and up without any issues but given his size and energy level we would not recommend him for a home with children under 6 or children that are not accustomed to large dogs.  

Duke does well with the other dogs in his foster home and navigates play groups well. He is a sensitive soul and gets his feelings hurt pretty easily which is in contrast of his lack of manners when meeting new dogs. He can be a typical pushy young dog when meeting new dogs and gets his feelings hurt when the other dog tells him to knock it off. He is learning with every interaction though and getting a good handle on social behavior. Duke has not been around any dogs under 40 lbs nor has he been tested with cats.

Macy came from a rural part of Kentucky where she was live-trapped after being born to a pack of Shepherds that were free-roaming on a farm. Macy had zero human contact prior to being trapped and has been very slow to warm up. She is considered semi-feral at this point and is still overcoming her fears. 

Macy prefers to avoid all human contact but has begrudgingly learned how to walk on a leash and tolerate being handled for daily living. Macy is a fear biter and if cornered - such as when she is in her crate and needs to come out - she will lash out in fear. If you move slowly with Macy she settles down and will allow you to handle her but she gets overwhelmed easily when rushed. Macy is going to require extensive ongoing handling, training, and socialization coupled with lots of patience as she continues to grow and bond. 

Macy connects with other dogs much better than she does people as a result of her early life in a pack. She does well meeting new dogs and is quick to follow their lead. She isn't at a place of comfort that she plays often but every now and then she will forget the people are around and start to play with one of the other young dogs. Macy has not been around cats or small dogs although she is relatively small herself. We do not know how she would do as there is not true way to test her given her discomfort on leash. 

Macy has a sweet soul and is trying her best to overcome her fears and bond with the people around her. Macy is searching for a home that can provide her a stable environment and ongoing work as she continues to grow beyond her past.

These girls have been through a lot together and we would like them to live their lives out together in the perfect home. Crissy and Molly lived with one owner most of their adult lives. He passed away roughly 8 months ago and a family friend agreed to take the two girls to avoid them being sent to the shelter. Their previous owner lived in Florida so the girls were transported from Florida to Kentucky to settle in with the family friend. Unfortunately, just as these girls were settling and really starting to get comfortable again the new owner accepted a new position  with her job and was transferred to Texas and did not plan to take the two senior girls with her so they were surrendered to our facility. These girls are very easy going, Molly is very sweet and happy to see everyone, Crissy can be a bit shy at first but will quickly approach for attention, Crissy just isn't as excitable as Molly. Both are very mild mannered and are fine with other animals. As far as we know they are housebroke, Molly had a lipoma (fatty growth) removed from her leg when she was spayed but there is no need for any additional treatment. Crissy had a large wart taken off her ear when she was spayed but again, there is no need for additional treatment. These girls have been given a clean bill of health and are just looking for the perfect family to love them and give them the stability they are desperate for."

Shiloh was completely feral when he arrived with Tier Haven from Hazard, Kentucky. He clearly had never been handled prior to this time and we are unaware of the circumstances surrounding his first few months.

Shiloh still has a very long way to go in trusting people. He has zero confidence in himself or the world around him resulting in a very timid and shy dog. Shiloh has no fear aggression and has never lashed out but is going to require a home with the patience to work with him to overcome his past. Shiloh does really well with people from a distance of about 5-7 feet and will linger on the outskirts of interactions but doesn't know what to do when the attention is turned to him. Shiloh will come up and nudge from behind seeking attention but does best when there isn't a big fuss made about it. He has a desire to be around people but is still so unsure of him.

Shiloh does great with other dogs and really relies on them for social cues. He was running with another dog - Bentley - who we suspect is his brother. Shiloh was definitely the follower and has stayed true to that role. He does great with other dogs and has learned how to navigate play groups really well. He would really benefit from having another dog or group of dogs in a home to show him the ropes and help him overcome his fears.

A volunteer reached out to us about Shiloh within minutes of when he was scheduled to be euthanized - there was certainly a large hand guiding him to safety and we hope to see him fulfill his potential with a loving home.

Monster is a super loving, sweet girl who loves cuddling - she'd be the perfect companion for those cold winter nights which are surely on their way! Her favorite thing to do is run laps around the backyard and play with tennis balls. She especially loves to do that in the winter time in the snow.

Monster is a 7-year-old Shepherd mix who weighs 55 pounds. She is spayed & is up to date on her shots. She has been in her current home for the past 3 years but recently she has started scuffling with the other female in the home. She loves people but should go to a home where the kids are older plus she is not a fan of cats.

If you're interested in adopting her, please contact her owner directly. Kaitlin at 973 567 1586 or by emailing metalkatart@gmail.com - Monster is currently located in Keyport, NJ."

As she was being rescued, she went into labor and delivered 5 beautiful, healthy babies. GiGi was a great Mom to her precious babies and were adopted. GiGi was scared to death of everything and has now finally begun to trust humans again. She deserves her own home where she can live the life of the happy girl she is now. She will need a special home that has the time to give her that she will need to settle in and feel safe. She is still scared of loud noises and any fast movement. It takes her a few days to feel safe around new people. There can not be any young children in her home as they would terrify her. GiGi wants to find her forever home and hopes you are looking for her, too. She loves to be around her person and will lay by you as long as you pet her. Please consider this very deserving little girl.  You must be in or very near the Louisville, Ky. area to adopt Gigi. Her perfect home would be with an older woman that is home a lot of the time. You must have puppy mill experience to be considered for this dog.

This dog requires an above ground structural fence for adoption. If you do not have one, do not apply for this dog. Please read her bio, if you do not live in or near Louisville, have no prior puppy mill experience or do not have a fenced yard, do not email me asking if any or all of the requirements are negotiable, they are not.  I will delete your request.

This makes us extremely qualified to say without reservation, Martha is one of the sweetest mill dogs we've ever rescued. Bulldogs can have special health needs such as properly cleaning the folds in the skin on their faces, and treating their eyes with ointment if they get yucky. Martha is also a former breeding dog so her tummy does and will continue to hang down (if this bothers you pls do not apply, it is who she is and nothing can be done to pop everything back in place).

Meet and greets are only scheduled with approved adopters, so please apply on our website.

Pria is a 5 month old terrier mix who came to us from Laurel County.  She is working on her cuddling skills and can be slightly mischievous! Pria takes a while to warm up to new people and needs some patience, but is the most delightful and devoted little girl once she does. She currently weighs 16lbs and her adult weight will likely not exceed 25lbs.

She enjoys being around other dogs and would absolutely LOVE a home with another dog to follow around and play with. Pria is very playful and has all the cute puppy mannerisms, without all that crazy puppy energy! She loves plush toys and can play happily with them all on her own. She has a very cute little howl-bark that she does when she's happy or wants attention and makes her foster family laugh with it all the time.

Pria is crate-trained and house-trained. She is fearful around small kids, so she'd do best in a home with older kids. She would also do best having another dog in the home.

She gets to sleep in her foster parents' bed and sleeps in a little ball on the end of the bed mostly, but sometimes her foster mom wakes up with a little Pria cuddled up in her neck. Some of Pria's favorite things include tennis balls, tiny dinosaur toys, long naps, chewing on bones in comfy beds, whipped cream, and being outside.

ROXIE is a BEAUTIFUL and SWEET Brindle and White American Pitbull Terrier/Labrador Retriever Mix.  She is approximately four (4) years old and weighs 70 lbs.  ROXIE is spayed and is up to date on all vaccinations including rabies. She is currently on HW prevention.   She is house trained.   ROXIE loves people. Adults and older children will be great for her.   

She is very smart and knows some commands such as: sit, lie down, and taking food gently. With additional training, she could learn much, much more! 

ROXIE loves other dogs and adores people. In fact, she would love to spend all her time hanging out with her people and have a dog sibling to hang out with.   She chases cats, so a home without kitties would be best. The fastest way to her heart is through a belly rub.   

ROXIE is still young and gets anxious when left all alone, so she would need to be crated when you leave home.  ROXIE will need positive crate training.  She has met with a great trainer (Total Pet Care LLC.) and everyone thinks that with someone who can give her the training, time and patience that she needs, ROXIE will be able to overcome her separation anxiety!  She will win over any pet sitter or dog walker that may help throughout the day. Total Pet Care LLC will also donate an e-session for foster/adopter transition counseling.  She is a loyal, loving and affectionate girl just waiting to find her forever home. Is it you?' 

ROXIE is currently located in Lillington, NC. 

If you are interested in adopting ROXIE, please contact Rebecca Gridley via e-mail to: totalpetnc@gmail.com"

He is an absolute sweetheart. Excellent with cats, dogs, chickens and horses. Rocky is a favorite here. He had a pretty rough start to life. His original family didnât understand ACDs at all and disciplined him for things like heeling kids and nipping heels. To the point of being kicked so hard his hip was shattered. ACDRA had FHO surgery performed and this boy is good as new. Because of this he does have fear aggression towards young children. Older kind kids he is great with. 

Rocky was also diagnosed with diabetes insipidis. Not to be confused with diabetes. This condition does require eye drops twice a day for life. No exceptions. This condition is managed 100% as long as you administer his meds which he is a perfect gentleman for. Rocky is a solid citizen with an amazing disposition.

When Gracie got here she was scared, we let her decompress for a day then started working with her, what a lovely girl indeed. Gracie takes some time to warm up but she eventually does and has a heart of gold. She is good with other dogs, we have not tested with cats yet but that can be done if required. We also would suggest older children since they would understand on how to go slow with Gracie Lee. She so deserves a family of her own and she is patiently waiting.

Hi! My name is Kinzey, and I am a 6 year old American Foxhound mix. I was adopted 4 years ago, and my new mommy and I were absolutely crazy about each other. Sadly, my new mommy passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. Now, I am back in a foster home, and while I really like it here, I would love to find my fur-ever home again. I am a silly, smart, loveable, playful cuddlebug. I like to play, but I am perfectly content to amuse myself while you do your thing, and I love to snuggle up next to you while you relax. I give the best hugs!!! I'm a little shy around new people, but with a little time and patience, I always come around. I am house-trained and love to go for car rides and WALKS - walks are the BEST!!! My foster says that I am close to being the PERFECT DOG. I attach to my family very quickly and have some anxiety when they leave me alone. I can bust out of crates and would do best in a home with a stay at home parent, not a necessity; however, I have destroyed some things I shouldn't have, such as carpeting because I was trying to get to my family. I am spayed, microchipped, and up to date on all my vaccinations. If you would like to meet me (and I sure HOPE you do!), please fill out a no-obligation, online application at animalfriendsva.org/animals, and scroll down to Kinzey, (the pretty one waiting for a home!). On that page is my application.

I will also be at all of our adoption events and you can bring me treats to help fatten me up.

Spice was surrendered by her family of 8 years because they have small children, including a 10 month old crawling baby.  Spice has become blind from glaucoma, and a bit anxious as a result.  The family was worried about keeping Spice around a crawling baby.  She has been overall a wonderful pet for this family. We are now looking for a quiet home for her for her later years.  She is 9 years old and weighs 40 pounds. We feel she would do best in a home with a gentle, older dog or with a person who is home most of the time.  She would just need to be fed separately from another dog, as she does protect her food from other dogs. We don't know how she would be with a cat, so a cat free home is probably best for her. In her 8 years, she has nipped one time, and that was after she became blind, and a new (not the usual) dogwalker came in and tried to take her out of the bathroom, where she was hiding.  She is fine with people in general. There is no adoption fee for this sweet girl, as we just want to find the right home for her.

Annie/Daisy is an Australian Cattle Dog(Blue Heeler)/Hound mix puppy who is just under under 2 years old and about 45 pounds.
Annie/Daisy is a sweet dog.. She is very content to lay around the house, but also loves to play outside and can show unending energy when chasing a ball or hiking. Her favorite words are âgo for a walk,â âball,\"" âoutside,â and \""go for a ride.\"" She loves to chew, but destroys toys quickly, so she needs sturdy objects such as elk antlers to gnaw on. She has been pretty good about not destroying household items. She is housebroken and is trained to nose bells hung on the door to ask to go out. She is crate trained and likes her crate, but hasnât been put in it for months. She sleeps on a dog bed on the floor of a bedroom. She is smart and knows several commands, including âsit,â âlie down,â âstay,â âcome,â âdrop it,â and âleave it.â  She takes a little while to warm up to some dogs, but others she loves to run and play with. She is a herder by nature..   She would do best in a home where she will be played with and go on hikes. Annie/Daisy would do best with older children. If you can give Annie/Daisy her forever home, please apply today. Her adoption fee is $400.

My name is Sasha. I am a beautiful beautiful 85 lb, 4 year old Great Pyrenees Mix. I am located in MA and looking for a home! I am your classic Pyr... I like to run around a fenced yard, patrol and chase critters but I also love to lounge and just hang out with you. I get attached to my people and want to take on the world. So, I really need a person that understands my breed and can work with me on some of my confidence issues. I am naturally protective of my people and my home (its just the way my breed is sometimes!) so I need a person who can help me with that task so I don't think I have to do it all myself! I know lots of commands, I am housebroken, good when left alone and really just looking for a person or couple to chill out with. I am good at walking on leash and in the car! I need a leader to show me support and lots of love and positive reinforcement but also to accept me as me!  If you have kids, I would really appreciate if they are 10 and up so they understand that I like to eat alone and just sometimes act like the princess I am. 
 Other dogs - that's okay but if they could be medium or large, I would appreciate it too.  Also, my new owner, if I am joining another dog needs to be confident in setting boundaries and slow introductions.  I live as an only now so that will take some adjustment!

I do!

But I donât have to go out west to be happy! I live in Massachusetts and I love it here! 

I am a 4 year old, male Anatolian Shepherd mix with a long luxurious coat that has finally filled back in. My first owner had me locked up a lot and let my coat get all funky due to my allergies, but with medicine and good food I am feeling so much better! In the winter I felt my best, but these pesky allergies seem to creep up on me in the spring and summer and make me itch! So annoying!

If  you want to adopt me, I do have a few requirements. First, no kids! They can be overwhelming and I like to be able to relax and snooze in peace! Second, Iâd like to be the only boy dog in the home (or only dog). Right now I live with two sisters and a brother - and boy do my brother and I get on each others nerves! I also have horse and cat friends at home and am a great farm dog!

I am a gentle ball of fluff at 125 pounds and take up a whole big dog bed. I love to sleep on the floor by your bed incase you need me at night, so no worries about trying to fit me in your bed! 

I have excellent house manners and would never go on any furniture or jump around in the house! I am a gentleman so I donât need a crate and get to pick any room I want to relax in. I will even let you know if someone comes over, but I always greet them with affection.

I enjoy car rides, walks at the park and always stick right by my moms side. I attract a LOT of attention everywhere I go and strangers always love to pat me! I am very handsome if you canât tell from my pictures!! 

Do you think weâd be a good fit? If so, let my mom know! She knows me really well and can tell you how fantastic I am! â

BOOMER was an owner surrender on 1st September 2019 due to the fact that he and his sibling were starting to not get along and due to a fight between the brothers, Boomer was going to be euthanized. Neither siblings were neutered and so most likely hormones and common sibling rivalry.

BOOMER is a handsome Foxhound who is neutered, just had his 3 year booster rabies vaccine, core vaccines, heartworm/tick disease tested negative, de-wormed, monthly heartworm and flea/tick prevention and micro-chipped He has an estimated date of birth of 25 August 2018 and weighs 65 pounds.

Following his neuter on 9th September 2019, Boomer went home to stay with a foster family who live in the Litchfield, Maine area, just south from Augusta and is acclimating well and the foster family adore him.

Notes from his foster family:

BOOMER is a GREAT boy he is very affectionate, knows a few basic commands and loves to play. He definitely has that \""hound\"" personality

and likes the company of other dogs, children, and adults and is heartbroken when left alone. Boomer has not been acclimated to cats but I think he would do fine. Hounds need a lot exercise and the foster family is currently working on leash and obedience training. Boomer is house trained and will let you know by whining or scratching at the door.

At 65 pounds, Boomer is a strapping young hound and basically mild mannered in the home. Hounds can be independent and stubborn in nature, particularly if their nose is in pursuit of an outdoor smell. Boomer is lovable in nature and will definitely win you over with his charm, love and loyalty.

On intake from the rescue.

I was informed by the family giving him up that Boomer has lived with his sibling, another dog, two small children and his mum and dad and was a wonderful part of the family. He has never shown any aggression, was well behaved, house-trained, he would go on long walks, play frisbee, chew on bones and a Kong and LOVED people.

When Boomer arrived at the rescue he was clearly stressed, upset and unsure what was going on. He has never been away from his brother and of course being left by his dad whom he has lived with since he was a small puppy caused some anxiety. He did settle down after a while and met some of the dogs. Not being fixed when he arrived he was a bit \""frisky\"" with some of the dogs and so it was best to keep him separate until he has been neutered. He is in the house with the dogs, just living at the other end, but he does lie and sit next to the gate dividing them and is doing great making friends this way. He is definitely a social boy and I am sure when neutered there will be no issues, his family said he was never a problem around dogs, animals or humans and had two very small human siblings whom he adored.

BOOMER needs a family that lives in the country or are very outdoorsy and active, where he has a lot of places to explore, however, working on training and recall would be extremely important before he is allowed to run loose because being a hound, he will most likely be very easily distracted and would most definitely chase after squirrels and wildlife. A family that can take him on daily runs in rural areas, would be a great for him and with no distractions of people or other dogs an enjoyable activity. He is used to living with a family and so when alone, he does have that loud hound bark/howl, so plenty of interaction and mental stimulation. BOOMER loves toys, if they have a squeak in all the better, he will play for hours happily and I am sure the puzzle toys for dogs would help keep him entertained.

BOOMER is available for adoption from Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue for an adoption fee of $400.

This fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food and anything else that is needed. If you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the APPLICATION tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 2-4 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.

Please do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks. http://www.giveadogahome-sanantonio.org

BOOMER is located with a foster family in Litchfield, Maine (just south of Augusta). We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. Sebec is located just outside the towns of Dover-Foxcroft and Milo (approx 8 miles) and approx 45 miles from Bangor. There are also lots of hotels, motels, pet friendly accommodations and wonderful camp-sites for the more adventurous families and what a great way to get to know your new best friend. If there are options to arrange transport, we will work with you to make it happen.Give a Dog a Home, German Shepherd Dog Rescue

giveadogahome@live.com

All pets adopted will be spay/neutered, micro-chipped, de-wormed,heartworm tested, rabies and relevant vaccinations.

NO DOG WILL BE ADOPTED TO BE AN OUTSIDE DOG!

If you would like to start the adoption our process is below:

Submit Application with two personal references and a vet reference.

If you have never had pets and do not have a vet, we will need THREE personal references.

Ensure references are people who know you and your lifestyle well.

Applicant MUST inform vet and references that someone from GaDaH will be calling.

As long as we are able to contact your vet and references, it takes just 1-3 days to process and hopefully approve applications.

If you rent we will need an approval letter for the breed of dog you are wanting to adopt from your landlord on official letterhead paper or email.

Rescue processes and hopefully approves applications.

Once approved, rescue invites applicant to come to the rescue to meet your chosen dog/s, spend time with him/her

and then hopefully take him/her home.

We do NOT hold dogs so if you are unable to come within a week or so of submitting your application the dog will still be available for adoption to other families.

For Canadian adopters, all that is needed to get them across the border into Canada is a current rabies certificate and proof of adoption, which is the adoption contract. Both of which are included in the medical file you will get when you adopt. (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/by-country/pettravel-canada)

Ensure ALL Fields are filled in, if something is relevant, then put n/a or something in so it recognizes an entry.

We do not recommend using a phone or ipad since these applications for some reason don't tend to come through and you will have spent a lot of time on the application for nothing as it will need to be re-done.

Once we have you approved we can schedule an appointment for you to come to meet

him/her at the rescue in Sebec, Mane and then hopefully take them home to start your new life.

I just have to work on an appointment basis as I run a boarding/day care business and the rescue and so am really busy, but by planning ahead of time I can be pretty flexible.

BUSTER is neutered, core vaccines, rabies, de-wormed and micro-chipped. He has an estimated date of birth of 16 November 2018 and weighS around 15.00 pounds. He is listed as a Lab/Boxer mix. We have no way of knowing the exact breed, it is up to individuals to decide what breed they think is most likely.

Since being at the rescue BUSTER has lived amongst a lot of dogs of all ages and sizes ranging from small chi's, middle sized dogs up to adult German Shepherds and so he is very dog socialized and very confident. He is friendly with people and has enjoyed cuddles from a friends 7 year old granddaughter.

We do not have cats or livestock at the rescue so cannot comment on how he would be around them.

BUSTER is young and used to being around lots of dogs so we are hoping for a family who either adopts another rescue or who has other pets at home. He is a young pup and so chewing is very much to be expected. He does use pee pads but also at times does use the dog door to go outside. He will need house training along with all basic training, manners and general behaviour. His personality is still developing and so it will be up to the family to ensure he stays a loving, gentle, playful, affectionate pup whilst growing into an adult dog.

Since being at the rescue he is totally loving life, he loves to play with toys, chew on hooves and horns, wrestle and chase with the other dogs and get lots of love and cuddles as much as he can. He is high energy and he feeds of the excitement of the other dogs, but does calm down and settle after a while. He is a great boy who has never shown any kind of aggression in any way.

As with all rescue's he needs guidance and training and we recommend families go through at least the basics of training with him themselves so that boundaries, personalities and body language can be learned from each other. BUSTER is very responsive and training would be fun and easy as long as proper training techniques are followed and are consistent.

We do not recommend dog parks for several weeks, if not months, it is so very important for families and dogs to form a strong bond and get to know each other before exposing them to the potential dangers of dog parks. Although all GaDaH dogs are very well socialized with other dogs, lots of other dogs have not had the benefit of this socialization and do not always know how to play and act with other dogs. You also do not know the control the other families have over their dogs and you should always have a good recall for your adopted dog before going to dog parks.

He is going to be a medium / large dog and so we are looking for an active family who goes out and about and intends to take their new family member as many places with them as possible.

BUSTER would benefit from a family that goes on walks and adventures and road trips together. We do not recommend dog parks it is so very important for families and dogs to form a strong bond and get to know each other before exposing them to the potential dangers of dog parks. Although all GaDaH dogs are very well socialized with other dogs, lots of other dogs have not had the benefit of this socialization and do not always know how to play and act with other dogs. You also do not know the control the other families have over their dogs and you should always have a good recall for your adopted dog before going to dog parks.

We do NOT adopt puppies out to be either emotional support or service dogs, but we welcome applications for out adult dogs.

All dogs (except dogs saved from China) are available for adoption for an adoption fee of $550.

Canadian adopters need to know that customs charge 15% taxes when entering into Canada. This fee is not negotiable and is used to cover the rescue costs of pulling, vetting, health certificate, transport from Texas to Maine, monthly preventatives, supplements, food and anything else that is needed.

If you feel that you have the heart and home to give this precious soul a wonderful life, please go to our website, under the APPLICATION tab, complete, then submit the APPLICATION. Our process takes around 2-4 days, and ensuring your references are aware that we will be calling, could speed up the process. Once you have been approved, we discuss any questions in regards to the dog you are wanting to adopt, then you complete and submit the contract, make payment and then we can work out the pick up / transport arrangements.

Please do NOT submit an application if you are not looking to take home a new best friend within the next few weeks.

ALL Dogs are LOCATED AT THE RESCUE IN SEBEC, MAINE.
We post in various states along the east coast and Canada where we have had lots of successful adoptions to enable more exposure for these beautiful saved souls. Families will need to be prepared to travel to the rescue to meet and take home their new best friend. Sebec is located just outside the towns of Dover-Foxcroft and Milo (approx 8 miles) and approx 45 miles from Bangor. There are also lots of hotels, motels, pet friendly accommodations and wonderful camp-sites for the more adventurous families and what a great way to get to know your new best friend. If there are options to arrange transport, we will work with you to make it happen.

All pets adopted will be spay/neutered, micro-chipped, de-wormed,heartworm tested, rabies and relevant vaccinations.

NO DOG WILL BE ADOPTED TO BE AN OUTSIDE DOG!

If you would like to start the adoption our process is below:

Submit Application with two personal references and a vet reference.

If you have never had pets and do not have a vet, we will need THREE personal references.

Ensure references are people who know you and your lifestyle well.

Applicant MUST inform vet and references that someone from GaDaH will be calling.

As long as we are able to contact your vet and references, it takes just 1-3 days to process and hopefully approve applications.

If you rent we will need an approval letter for the breed of dog you are wanting to adopt from your landlord on official letterhead paper or email.

Rescue processes and hopefully approves applications.

Once approved, rescue invites applicant to come to the rescue to meet your chosen dog/s, spend time with him/her

and then hopefully take him/her home.

We do NOT hold dogs so if you are unable to come within a week or so of submitting your application the dog will still be available for adoption to other families.

For Canadian adopters, all that is needed to get them across the border into Canada is a current rabies certificate and proof of adoption, which is the adoption contract. Both of which are included in the medical file you will get when you adopt. (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/by-country/pettravel-canada)

Ensure ALL Fields are filled in, if something is relevant, then put n/a or something in so it recognizes an entry.

We do not recommend using a phone or ipad since these applications for some reason don't tend to come through and you will have spent a lot of time on the application for nothing as it will need to be re-done.

Once we have you approved we can schedule an appointment for you to come to meet

him/her at the rescue in Sebec, Mane and then hopefully take them home to start your new life.

I just have to work on an appointment basis as I run a boarding/day care business and the rescue and so am really busy, but by planning ahead of time I can be pretty flexible.

COURTESY POSTING/REHOMING NEEDED

Seeking a loving, active person/family to adopt a sweet border collie/Australian Shepherd mix. Bandit is 7 years old. He has been with the same family his whole life. As our family grew, with a toddler and another baby on the way, Bandit is starting to need a different family life. He truly is a sweet, loving and smart dog. He needs lots of exercise. He loves to cuddle, and is good with children over the age of 10. He does have anxiety, for example he is very sensitive to clicking noises, fans, blowing noises (such as blowing out a candle). Before we had children, my now husband and I were able to train Bandit quite easily to be more tolerant of these things, but as our attention gets drawn away from his behavioral training, he does still struggle with these, and some other, daily household routine noises. He is housebroken, and gets along with other dogs (has lived with a Sheltie for most of his life without issues). He is up to date on all shots, is fixed, and has had consistent veterinary appointments. Serious inquiries only. This is a very difficult decision for us, and would love to have an âopenâ adoption, where we could still see Bandit on occasion, at your convenience of course.

Brew is an English Bulldog we saved from a high kill shelter in Tampa. She is 8 years old and in a neglected state. She has a medical history of arthritis spondylosis, she is heartworm positive and required a removal of a blueberry sized mammary node during spay. She is underweight at 35 pounds and will require 3 meals a day. She is quiet,sleeps a lot and the only issue we have seen is some guarding of her xpen area when other dogs nose around. She's fine with other dogs but offers no interactions and turns her head away. Once we have her tuned up she will be available for adoption or long term fostering through heartworm treatment. If you are interested in Brew and have experience with English Bulldogs please contact us. PUPDATE. Brew has been with us for almost a week. She has seen our vet. Her liver values were abnormal and we have had her on supplements and will retest the 2nd week of Sept. She has gotten more energetic,is eating well, and actually is playing with some of the other dogs. She loves people and absolutely loves being pet. She is actually chasing flies! She is becoming a dog again!! Once we do our vet re-check, she will be available for foster to adopt or medical foster. We are a foster-based rescue organization with foster homes throughout the state of Florida. We predominantly save dogs from municipal shelters throughout the Southeastern U.S. Our rescue dogs live in foster homes - there is no central facility.

Update: Sadie and Jada will soon be seeing a veterinary ophthalmologist for a complete exam.

Five year old Jada and her best buddy, six year old Sadie, are a truly bonded pair - and they're both blind.

Although Sadie, a neutered male, is blind he always knows where Jada is - and she relies on him. When they go for leash walks with their mom, Sadie is the leader and he walks ahead of his mom and Jada follows behind her - it's quite the parade.

Sadie was especially attached to his dad who died a few months ago. He was his loyal companion and stayed right with him throughout his illness. He was also with him when he died.

Jada and Sadie's owner now can't afford to care for them and she's anxious to get them both to a veterinary ophthalmologist for a thorough eye exam and treatment.

Our wonderful volunteer took them both to be groomed and vetted the week of August 7th.

The groomers adored both dogs. \""Jada is a real sweetheart\"" and Sadie was fine once he was lifted onto the grooming table (because he is blind he was a bit panicked by being lifted by strangers but he settled down quickly.) Now both dogs are clean and beautiful!

Our vet diagnosed Jada with juvenile cataracts and we hope they're operable and she can regain some sight. Sadie has cataracts and glaucoma, he's now on two eye medications to help reduce the pressure in his eyes.

The immediate need is to find a loving, caring adult only home for these two special cockers. CSRNE will pay for all ophthalmological care and medications. Our vet said both dogs are otherwise in good health.

Both Jada And Sadie were purchased from a Manchester, NH pet store at 12 weeks of age. They started going blind when they were about 4 years old. Their condition, juvenile cataracts, is genetic so the purchased them from an irresponsible puppy  mill that is breeding cocker puppies with the gene  for juvenile cataracts. But quite frankly the puppy mill doesn't care - they've already gotten their money and now it's Jada and Sadie who will pay the real price for the irresponsible breeding practices of mercenary puppy mills and the pet stores who so carelessly purchase their puppies.

We can only help dogs like Jada and Sadie if you, our friends, become their advocates. Do you know a special person who might be willing to give these two dogs the care and attention they so deserve?

We know we're looking for a rare individual who has the time to care for Jada and Sadie but we're hoping their cocker angel is out there somewhere willing and able to help these two devoted cockers.

We ask everyone interested in adopting to please fill out and send in our adoption application and restraint agreement before we invite you to meet any dogs.   Once your application is approved, we can proceed!

Chance is a 2 year old American pit bull mix (looks like some bulldog might be in that mix!) 

He was originally adopted from the Maricopa County shelter, but family feels he would be better suited to a home where the family has more time for him - they just don't. He is neutered, microchipped and vaccinated until August. Heâs a super sweet boy, and is very active. He loves sleeping in bed like a human. Good with small dogs and children. He has never been around big dogs but family feels sure that with slow introduction and comfort he will adjust perfectly. 

Please fill out an adoption form and we will forward it on to Chance's current family for review.

Woodrow is a sweet mostly chocolate Lab boy, 65-75 pounds, approx 5-6 years old. Woodrow has come to us from our local animal control in Marshall County and with us 2 weeks so far. He is going to make someone a great companion dog! Woodrow gets along great with all dogs. He is doesnât pay attention to horses, chickens and tested fine around a cat. In fact, the cat swatted him and he walked away. He loves to be around his person and loves to just follow you around. A stay-at-home or work-from-home individual would be ideal that can shower him with love. Woodrow even when dogs are playing around him, he prefers to be right by your side. He sits on cue and he is house trained. He would be a fantastic companion dog for a single lady since he does show a little bit of fear towards men, but nothing he cannot overcome with patience. He will be apprehensive at first and may growl at a man but its harmless. Thereâs absolutely no aggression in Woodrow at all he is definitely a lover. He would do best around older kids or teens versus young babies since he is a bigger dog and doesnât give you much personal space, but itâs only because he craves to be acknowledged. Poor fellow must have not gotten very much attention in the past and his medical vetting speaks volumes, so he longs for someone to just love him and in return, you will wonder âwho rescued whoâ. Woodrow unfortunately did test positive for heart worms, but we are treating him at no cost to an adoptive family. Woodrow has been recently medically vetted; neutered, up-to-date on all vaccines plus microchipped.

Dodge's Doggerings:
Hi everyone, my name is Dodge. I made it into my foster home after a 2-hour ride. I traveled well even with all my pent-up energy from being at the vet! I'm good with dogs and have met the gang here. I can be a little exuberant in my greeting but I am being given correction; especially by Belle (the lemon beagle). It seems I hadn't had a lot of exposure to other animals so I'm unknown with cats. I'm healthy and up-to-date on everything. I love playing with toys and FM played toss with me today. I would bring it back to her, but I preferred to keep the toy. I know how to \""sit\"" when asked, but my butt doesn't always stay there. FM says that I still need to adjust to being here and she knows I will shine!
Love,
Dodge

She weighs 44 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Gracie is a happy but shy girl, who loves adorably once she trusts you, but will take a bit of time and some caution to earn that trust. She absolutely loves other dogs, and has never met one she doesn't like. For this girl, the more dogs in her world, the better. If you are giving affection to another dog, her curiosity will get the better of her and she'll almost immediately come up to investigate. She can be a bit hand shy, even once she trusts you, so just needs humans that will go slow and understand to give her time. When she's in her element, she is silly, rolling on the grass, spinning around and zooming as fast as she can to play \""tag\"" with the other dogs. And she's REALLY fast. She enjoys napping on the couch, and will allow herself to be a pillow for the other dogs. She also likes to sleep in bed with her humans and is incredibly silly in the mornings as she considers the bed a safe zone - she'll roll on her back and beg for belly rubs and play bitey-face. She especially loves when the other dogs join in the fun. She's excellent in the crate, and foster mom has spied her sleeping in the crate belly up while she's at work. Gracie prefers to eat alone, and will quickly eat her meals in her crate, or in a separate room, but is nervous eating in front of humans, unless it's people food that you are sharing with her (which she loves!). Her leash skills are pretty good, but she would prefer walking on quiet streets and not on a busy road. Gracie is a shy dog, and is always going to be a bit shy. She warms up to new people, but prefers them in small groups and not making a lot of noise, please. She's not the dog for you if you have rambunctious teenagers (or adults), throw parties often, or if you're looking for a dog to take everywhere with you. She started her life sheltered in a pen, and didn't get the socialization with humans she should have at an early age, so they make her a bit nervous. She's incredibly sweet and loving, and will reward you with her sweet, happy, silly self if you give her love, patience and understanding.

She weighs 81 pounds but needs to lose about 5 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Kayla is a happy chocolate girl who likes belly rubs and running in the yard. She has been a loving and attentive mommy to multiple litters of puppies and now she is ready to take her turn in the spotlight. Sheâs a friendly girl with lots of energy who would do best with a family that will give her plenty of playtime outside, long walks, and lots of love. Kayla is good with dogs, but not cats and approved for kids 10 and up. Kayla is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking.

As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and send out an update. 

Foster family reports: Kayla has a vivacious, energetic personality. After spending much of her life outdoors, she is excited to be in her foster home. Her tail has not stopped wagging! She thinks she's a lap dog and would crawl in your lap with the slightest encouragement. She introduced herself to the resident lab with play bows and ran zoomies with him. She is friendly without being either dominant or submissive. Kayla had no problem navigating the hardwood floors. She can zoom up and down stairs. She likes watching TV, especially animal shows and Litter Robot advertisements, which bring her to her feet everytime. (Must be the cat!) She also enjoys watching squirrels outside. This former breeder girl had a litter quite recently and still has enlarged mammaries. She weighs 80 lbs but should weigh ~75. She shows interest in meeting children (approved age 10+). Kayla rode well in the car and walks nicely in an Easy Walk harness. She loved her first walk in the park. Although she came from a rural area, she does not seem bothered by traffic or loud noises. Kayla is food motivated, which should help with refreshing commands. Kayla is settling nicely into her foster home. She was a little over-amped when she first arrived but now she is able to settle in the house. She enjoys playing with the resident lab, and in fact, she is usually the initiator of play! She likes taking walks around the neighborhood, and we discovered that she is a retriever. Kayla did not appear to know her name or any commands, so we are working to teach her basic commands and leash skills. She walks pretty well with an EZ-Walk harness, doesn't pull, but will sniff a lot if you let her. She needs to be tethered in the car until she knows her commands or she will be in the driver's lap. She is not crated when we leave the house and she does not disturb anything. Kayla is super loving and affectionate. She has all the most desirable lab traits! She is a velcro dog to foster mom, but seems to do most of her lab leans on the men she meets. She has met the neighbors and their dogs and impressed them with her friendliness and beauty. Other dogs really like her, so she appears to share good vibes! We don't know yet whether she likes water. Her background continues to mystify us. She was photographed at intake living on a chain, but she also knows her way around a house, is interested in human food and would like to get up on the furniture (although not allowed by her current foster). Kayla is quite energetic for her age and will need regular walks and/or active time in the yard. Since she doesn't bark, navigates stairs easily and can be exercised on leash, Kayla is now approved for townhouses on a case-by-case basis.

Bella #12 weighs 103 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Bella #12 is a chunky, curly coated chocolate girl who used to live on a farm with 2 other labs and an indoor cat. Even though leash walking is new, she is starting to grasp the idea. She is a pretty strong gal, so an EasyWalk harness makes all the difference in the world. Bella isnât all that much into toys, but she does love to play and swim in the water. She isnât used to spending long hours alone, but hasnât shown any anxiety when left alone at her foster home. She is quiet and submissive but will bark once or twice at new people or dogs. Bella is not destructive at all and is housebroken. She has not been crated for the last 6 years or so. She does enjoy sleeping on the couch during the day and in the bedroom at night. Bella enjoys her car rides and never has to be asked twice to get in the car. 

UPDATE from Bellaâs foster family:  Bella is adorable. So sweet, completely housebroken, sleeps all night. She LOVES to go on walks. She gets so excited jumping up & down on her front feet! She's very smart & knows commands.. sit, shake, down, stay & wait. She's very good at stay! She will play with a toy for a while and she always meet me at the door with a toy in her mouth when I come home. I do not crate her and she's fine. She has not gotten into anything or torn anything up. She's pretty good on a leash but could use some more leash training because she is strong and used to being off leash on the farm. We are working on her diet and exercise regime!

She weighs 34 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Louise is an adorable, petite, and quiet girl who came from a hoarding situation. She is looking for a family to make her feel special and loved. She rode quietly in a crate in the car. She spent many months in a temporary foster home in WV and she is used to living with other dogs, so she will need to go to a home with another dog. She is good with dogs, unknown with cats, and approved for kids 10 and up. Louise is sweet, docile, and affectionate. She barks very little and she hasnât had any accidents inside the house. She always goes outside to do her business and is very good on a leash. Louise is still a little shy around new people; just a few pets from the right person will capture her heart and she will capture theirs.

 Louise (âLuluâ) is slowing coming out of her shell. Watching and helping her learn about the sweetness of life has been amazing. Lulu has been pretty clear about her likes and dislikes. She dislikes noise and unpredictability. She loves food (especially chicken!), chilling in a quiet space, walks on quiet paths, dog toys, and calm human and canine company. She plays with her foster brother and approaches dogs on walks with confidence. Sweet Lulu is house- and crate-trained, very quiet, and as gentle as they come. She asks for nothing but a patient family with a dog that will continue to pamper her and appreciate the joy of seeing this girl blossom.

She weighs 66 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Millie is good with other dogs. She was dog tested at the shelter and was fine. No cats for Millie because she will chase cats if they run. There's no kid history for Millie, so she's approved for kids ages 10 and up. Millie is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. For now, to avoid this, we are limiting placement to standalone, single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. After Millie has been in a foster home for at least a week or two, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and will send out an update. More on Millie soon! 

Foster family reports: Millie was feeling a bit under the weather but is doing much better and is ready to look for her new home! Millie is a wonderful pup. She is very loving and sweet and paid no attention to the caged bunnies in her previous foster. She did well in the crate, and seems to be house trained! She enjoyed playing with other pups but can be a bit bossy. She will likely do well with dogs who don't mind a more assertive lady.

Now that the pups have been adopted it is time for Candi to find her forever home. She has nice house manners and has free run of the house. At night she sleeps on a dog bed in the bedroom. Like all young, active dogs, she will need some additional training. Candi gets along fine with the resident dog and visiting dogs too. She enjoys plundering the toy chest. If you are sitting on the couch, she will join you to be close. She likes everyone she meets.

Rose is a very sweet and loving girl. She had a rough life and is very happy that lab rescue brought her in and especially to her fosters. She plays very well with the resident lab, sleeps on the couch with foster dad and cuddles on the couch with resident lab when play time is over. She has the best soulful eyes that are just screaming. THANK YOU! 

Rose is great with dogs and people but cats and kids are unknown. Therefore, approved for kids 10 and older. During Rose's exam, the vet noticed a lump in her throat. They asperated the lump and sadly she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She is not in any pain and unfortunately it is inoperable. She is not showing symptoms of being sick and continues to go about her day, playing with the other dogs, following foster mom around, snuggling on the couch, and constantly being spoiled. Sadly, Rose is considered to be in hospice right now.

Baby weighs 30 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Baby is the most charming, sweetest little pup. She is fearless and loves everyone and everything. She especially adores water! When foster mom was cleaning and refilling the pup pools in the yard, Baby had so much fun chasing the water and carrying the hose. She loves to cuddle and will fall asleep on the couch snuggled up with the other dogs, or next to foster mom. She loves playing with the big dogs and does her very best to keep up with them. She's curious about everything and loves to explore. Baby was born with a neurological condition that affects her movement. She sometimes weaves or stumbles when walking, and needs to be watched near stairs. She is on a low dose of Prednisone and 5mg of Omeprazole once/day to prevent an upset stomach. But this delightful girl still approaches everything full of excitement and joy. She is looking for someone who has a huge heart and maybe a friendly resident dog that will be her buddy. If you have a place in your heart for this sweet, sweet girl, her love will reward you ten-fold.

UPDATE from Babyâs foster family:  Baby's favorite thing to do is play with other dogs and snuggle with them or her humans. She often is found sleeping belly up, as close as she can get to the other dogs or foster mom, and snoring... She loves the new dog bed that she can nuzzle up in as well. Baby is learning to use the ramp to go down the short grouping of stairs outside to the yard, and is getting better at it! She is also learning to go up the big staircase in the house and doing great! She has found her voice and foster mom affectionately refers to her as \""bossy\"" when she barks because she wants to do something and hasn't quite figured out how yet. She also likes to bark at the big dogs to get them to play bitey-face with her on the couch. She's a sweet, silly, special girl, who is looking for forever humans that understand her limitations and help her break down the walls when she can.

She weighs 95 pounds but needs to lose about 20 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Marley is a very sweet girl. She would love to meet you so she can give you love and attention. She loves to be with you to play and get petted which I don't think she had a lot of until she came to us. She enjoys being outside playing with other dogs but thinks being inside with people is better. She is not interested in running around outside retrieving but will go get treats which she takes very nicely. She likes to go on walks which is good as she has to lose some extra weight. We see a vegetable and fruit diet in her future! Marley would like to meet a family that will give her love and attention. Kids 10 and up as we don't have history. Good with other dogs has been out with other LR pups at the kennel with no problems. No cat history. Knows sit, come and sometimes down. Not bad on lead, better when walking with an Easy Walk Harness. Crate trained, probably house trained as she is keeping her room clean at the kennel. If you are looking for a laid back, gentle soul, consider Marley. This dog is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. To avoid this, for now we are limiting placement to stand alone single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded. 

Foster family reports: Update We know that Marley is not her real name so we're trying different names. Right now we're calling her Penny, so we'll see. A couple more facts about Marley/Penny. We're not sure how she got to be so large but she's the most food-unmotivated lab! She may or may not eat her breakfast and she's really not into fruits or veggies. Her thyroid has been tested and is fine. We've never had a pup take treats so gently. We're used to the \""you may lose your fingers\"" type of lab. Marley/Penny will go to the door if she needs to do her business. She would like a family who's willing to take the time with her to help her feel comfortable and loved. She'd also like a couple walks a day to help her build up her stamina and lose some of those pesky pounds. She recently visited with a friend for a weekend sleepover and met two very dog-savvy cats. She initially appeared to want to play with them but that was more effort than she wanted to expend and she laid back down. Marley/Penny found the toy basket, and although she is not a huge player or retriever, she periodically picks up a tennis ball and brings it to you or gnaws on one of the many bones all over the house. She LOVES her walks she doesn't go far and not too fast but she loves all the smells and all the people and dogs met so far. Marley/Penny is a very easy dog that requires little more than a place to sleep, a few pats on her head, some belly scratches and some food. Do you have room in your heart and home for Penny?

He was allowed to wander around and when he wanrered into the wrong yard he was attacked by the dog that lived there. Once at the shelter his owner was called who never showed up to take him home.  Rudy would love a home that will allow him to give his love and have a soft bed and some ear scratches in return. Maybe a few treats as well. 

Foster update: Rudy is doing great in his foster home! He really warmed up to his fosters and is a sweet, affectionate boy. He has done well in his crate when alone during the day and sleeps in bed with the teenage daughter at night without problem. He gets along well with other dogs he encounters on walks. He does pull a little at squirrels, but he is not bad at all. He is learning to know the difference between his toys and general household items:) He is trying to work on sit, and heâs starting to learn no.

Regina weighs 26 pounds and is up to date on shots. She is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Regina is a very sweet and slightly shy girl. She is a bit slow to warm up to people but once she does she will show you just how sweet she is. She play bows and wiggles her entire body when she sees foster mom. Once she is comfortable with you she will surprise you by stealing kisses when she can. She would benefit most in a somewhat quieter household and a patient one so she can blossom at a more relaxed pace.  Regina gave birth to a rainbow of girls 8 weeks ago. Now that the girls are weaned she is looking for her fur-ever home. All of Regina's puppies have been adopted, and Regina has adjusted very well to life without little ones. She sleeps in a dog bed in the master bedroom. She loves to chase toys and will toss them up into the air with joy. She now tries to engage the resident dogs in play with lots of play bows and quick dashes away. She still LOVES to be outside as much as possible. Currently, she refuses all treats and loses all interest in other activities when strangers are around (this is a change from just a few weeks ago when she settled down nicely with female guests). She continues to change and make progress each week, so it may be a phase that she works through quickly. Her adoptive family will need to be patient while she adjusts to the changes in her life. She still needs to gain a few pounds - she is a picky eater, but will happily munch a dose of Philadelphia cream cheese:).

He weighs 62 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Blake is a sweet, happy boy. He is good with other dogs and used to live with two others in his previous home. We don't know how Blake is with cats. He is very curious and is quite interested in all the daily activity of the suburbs. He loves to look out the window at home and in the car. He has been fascinated by joggers and was completely mesmerized by a sprinkler. He has been very interested in everything the family is doing. He likes to lay in the kitchen while we are cooking and eating dinner, but never begs or gets into the garbage. Blake does not bark and does not jump on strangers. He has not had the opportunity to learn basic commands but has demonstrated he can learn quickly and responds when you correct him. He went from crazy dog on a leash to a calmer and responsive walker on the harness. Blake will make a great addition to a family and will quickly bond. He has loads of personality and has perfect house manners.

UPDATE from Blakeâs foster family:  Blake is a sweet, sweet boy and is doing great in his foster townhome. He is housebroken and has free reign over the house when his foster needs to be gone. He has not been crated; he did scratch at the door when left alone initially, but calmed after a couple of days. His foster works-from-home, so he does get a potty break every four hours. Blake is great with the fosterâs teenager. He knows sit, and he quickly learned paw! He is a great eater, is not protective of his food, and sleeps through the night. He gets excited when you first get home and tends to jump, but that is something that can be trained. Blake is a love bug and loves snuggling in your bed or the sofa - he would a family that will let him on the furniture:) 

Blake is a playful guy and walks ~4 miles each day to expend his energy. He is very strong, and his handler needs to be prepared for him to pull hard if he senses something he wants to investigate. He is learning to walk on a leash and doing MUCH better, but ongoing training is needed. He wants to meet people and dogs on his walks and does well; he has not spent time alone with other pups while with his fosters. Blake is a cuddly, fun-loving boy and is the perfect match for a family willing to give him the exercise and ongoing training he needs. 

Blake is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. For now, to avoid this, we are limiting placement to standalone, single family homes or townhomes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. After Blake has been in a foster home for at least a week or two, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and will send out an update.

Foster family reports: Monkey is sad because summer is almost over and she will not be able to wear her hat and shades anymore - she will have to shop for a scarf! She is a very good sport and is willing to sport attire to entertain her foster family. Her foster dad took her to Petco and she did great. She enjoyed the yummy smells and seeing all the other dogs. Monkey says hello and wants to share that she is a very calm and well behaved pup! She loves to lay around with her foster parents and the resident dogs. She likes to relax and loves rolling on her back and wriggling around so her tummy can be scratched. Monkey is very obedient and knows basic commands, such as sit and stay. She likes taking walks with her foster family and sitting outside on the deck, watching the world go by. She definitely watches for the rabbits to zoom past! Monkey's foster mom took her to Starbucks for a Puppercino and she loved it!

Chops weighs 55 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Chops came to us as a very scared pup, but his foster has been working very hard to socialize him and let him know that people and the world are not so bad. He has been building his confidence a little at a time. He is good with dogs but is still a puppy at heart, so can be a little annoying to the older, less playful dogs. He has become much more attentive to people and has started to show more affection and enjoy human contact more. His foster has been working with the collar and leash, but he still sometimes \""gator rolls\"" when the leash goes on so a fenced yard is a must for him. 

Chopâs perfect adopter would be: 
1) A home with less chaos and a family that is willing to show patience and continue to help him grow and learn. 
2) A home with another dog to help him with confidence. 
3) Someone willing to possibly \""visit\"" with him a few times before taking him home

He does have a few quirks which training should easily correct:  placing his paws on your shoulders while seated on the couch, thinking you want to continue playing after he \""releases\"" a toy or bone, barking at strangers at the door until he gets to meet them (he remembers them on subsequent visits so that is pretty handy). He does not have an aggressive bone in his body. Buddy is trustworthy alone at home and is not crated at night. Buddy is a great little guy!

Jax is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people, so Jax is approved for placement to stand alone single-family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area for now. 

Jax's teacher was grateful that he was such a good student. Because he grew up in a pen with his siblings and wasn't exposed to a lot of things, he can be a bit timid when you first meet, but he has a lovely disposition and warms up quickly. He enjoys the outdoors and taking hikes. He loves to run around the yard and will need to go to a family with a physical fence. Jax needs a family who will not leave him alone for a long work day. He is used to being with other dogs and loves their company. After he gets the right amount of exercise, he settles down for a nap. He doesn't like to be crated much, so that is a work in progress and he can stay for short periods with a frozen kong, or a favorite durable toy. This young boy has already proven that with the right amount of exercise and continued obedience training, he will be an amazing companion for someone who puts in the time. He comes with a complimentary 7-week Good Manners class at Peaceable Paws in Fairplay, MD. He is excited to find a forever home with a doggy buddy:) 

UPDATE FROM THE FOSTER: This sweet boy is very gentle and loving. He wants to be with companions, both canine and human. Jax has excellent leash manners, loves walks and is learning to go for runs with his foster brother. Jax loves being with other pups (the more the merrier!) and people. Nothing beats a good cuddle session after a full day of play - check out his snuggle with the resident black lab in the photos. If you like exciting outdoor adventures followed by late afternoon naps in the sunny spot, Jax is a perfect match. Jax had fun where he got to run on the trail, wrestle with the other dogs, and play with the humans. He squeezed in a nap in the sunny spot, beating the other pups to it. He loves to meet new people and dogs and play, play, play. This pup is full of joy and energy, and would love a family to share it with him!

He is affectionate and sweet but, will need someone to stand firm on the rules of the house. He is house and crate trained and knows all of his basic commands.Â Drake is a sweet and awesomely happy boy! Heâs a big, beautiful, block-headed dog that just wants to be in your lap. Drake knows sit and shake and appears to be crate trained. He slept quietly all night in his crate. Drake likes to retrieve. 

UPDATE FROM THE FOSTER: Drake is play time all day, and he has a full-on body wag! Handsome blockhead black lab, who is toy-obsessed and just wants to have fun. He loves attention and is doing well in training and with doggie day care. He is great with his people. Has a killer lab-lean and is very affectionate once he gets to know you. Drake is fine walking past other dogs on leash, but has no interest in engaging them to play. He is great with people but, not a fan of other dogs so, he needs to be the only dog in the household. Drake is learning his commands and loves human attention. Drake is full of life, and a huge fan of toys and tennis balls - he will even entertain himself. He needs to loose a few pounds, but playing fetch daily in the yard should definitely help him along with his weight-watchers program. He is a big fan of people and lots of fun. You won't regret giving this boy his forever home!  Drake is such an happy camper and so excited about life he rarely stands still - even when trying to get a picture to show the world how gorgeous he is. He's got the classic big blocky head and thick otter tail. He is not the most cuddly until you take him on an 8 mile hike - maybe after that he will snuggle of the couch. Drake thinks there is a lot to life and he is ready to see it all!!

He weighs 75 lbs and is naturally slender. Unfortunately, due to male-male aggression, Apollo needs to be rehomed to a loving family. He would do well in a home where someone could spend most of the day with him. He is looking for someone experienced with large dogs or northern breeds. Typical male malamute characteristics. He has moments of zoomies and then would lay next to you and watch TV. Apollo is an expert digger and occasionally tries to dig inside and outside. Apollo doesnât realize his size and loves laying in your lap and taking up the entire bed. 

Apollo would prefer to be the only pet in the household but has been getting along with a similarly sized female. He could never live with another male due to male-male aggression nor be around another male dog unsupervised. Apollo does mark in the house, but most likely this is due to the presence of another large male sharing the house. He will wear a belly band but that does not deter his marking. During walks, Apollo avoids other dogs except for his two husky friends. He responds well to the dog walker and loves to give kisses. 

Apollo loves all toys. He always has a toy in his mouth and wants to play fetch or get pets while he chews them. He is a good sitter and will do almost anything for a treat. Himalayan dog treats and fresh beef bones are some of his favorite chew treats. 

While not too fond of many dogs, Apollo loves people and is always eager to say hi to everyone on walks. He has not lived with children but enjoys meeting them on walks. Not recommended for homes with small children due to his size and stature.

Rulcho weighs 55 pounds and is up to date on shots. He is approved for homes with children 10 and up.

Foster update: Rulcho is wondering why no one is calling about him! He has become so much more confident . He LOVES other dogs and they make him so happy and give him added confidence. He loves toys and food puzzles especially. He is doing great with meeting new friends. He is house trained and crated trained and does well on leash. Rulcho would love a quieter home with a doggie buddy!!

Rulcho is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. For now, to avoid this, we are limiting placement to standalone, single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. After Rulcho has been in a foster home for at least a week or two, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and will send out an update.

These dogs are a bonded pair who must be adopted together.  They are approved for homes and townhomes with children ages 10 and up.

Foster update:  Smokey and Princess are a bonded brother and sister pair, ready to face whatever life sends their way! Life sent this precious pair a curve ball when their owner could no longer care for them. Now theyâre hoping Lab Rescue will send them a family who can appreciate the bounty of benefits that come with adding a senior (or 2) to your family: loving, laid back, house trained, donât need tons of exercise, gentle with kids, off the charts adorable frosted faces! These sweet seniors would be an easy addition to any family. 

Princess and Smokey here! Foster mom went on vacation so we did too! Now we're back and time to unpack our tennis balls. We had a great time at our vacation foster home. We got to go to some neighborhood parties and we even helped supervise a litter of foster puppies that came for a short visit. Our favorite part of the vacation was the teenagers! They would rub our ears and scratch our bellies and throw tennis balls for us in the yard! Sometimes we had to wait until lunchtime for them to wake up, but they were really fun to play with. We're happy to be back with foster mom, but we're still hoping that someone out there has a permanent place in their heart and their home for us. We are an easy pair that just continues to demonstrate how adaptable and easy going we are. From 10 days living in a hotel to 3 weeks with a vacation foster, we make ourselves at home and adapt to new people and places easily. All we need is a yard with some tennis balls and some people to love and snuggle!

Toby weighs 76 pounds and is up to date on shots. He is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Toby needs to spend his senior years with a family that will love and care for him every day. They will get a truly grateful, loving dog, perfect for taking along on adventures because his loyalty and loving personality will put smiles on any family that calls him theirs. 

Foster update:  Toby is a total sweetheart! He loves hanging out with his humans and is quite willing to be loved on:) He does well with the senior resident lab and enjoys their walks, trotting along side-by-side. He is more energetic than expected for his age and would enjoy long walks or a light run. Toby is not a fan of the crate, but that is okay because he can be trusted to have the run of the house. He does not care to be separated from his people when they are home (what lab does?!). 

Toby is approved for kids 7 and up, he previously lived with a boy and a girl and he loved to be with them. He is good with other dogs but no cats as he will chase them. Toby knows sit, shake, fetch and laydown. He pulls some on lead and would benefit from an Easy Walk harness. He is crate trained and has been keeping his room clean at the kennel.  He is also trained to an invisible fence. 

Toby is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. To avoid this, for now we are limiting placement to stand alone single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and send out an update. 

Toby is Heartworm Positive. Heartworm is highly treatable and treatment will be provided, at no cost to the adopter, at one of Lab Rescue's designated vets. Completing Heartworm treatment at the veterinarian designated by the Rescue is a requirement of adoption. Adopters can learn more about Heartworm at www.lab-rescue.org/heartworm.

Scout weighs 50 pounds and is up to date on shots. He is approved for homes with children ages 15 and up.

Foster update:  Scout is a shy sweetheart who is getting used to life in the city. He rode like a dream for the long drive from the vet to his foster. He is doing fine in a townhouse and learned to negotiate the stairs. He isnât crazy about being put in his crate, but he will quiet down quickly and is content to sleep there. Scout doesnât pull on his leash unless he spies a squirrel or rabbit and he seems okay with traffic noises. He ignores the cat. 

Scout loves to be near to his people and wants to have his foster in sight at all times, or better yet, snooze beside her on the couch. He needs a calm home and adopters that will be patient as he learns more about the world! Scout needs to gain confidence but he is so eager to please and is a real love bug! Scout takes a few minutes to warm up but, if you get down on the ground and let him come to you - he will warm up and snuggle. He loves treats. He will need an experienced owner who will continue with his training to teach him that life can be fun!

Duke is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people, so Duke is approved for placement to stand alone single-family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area for now. 

Duke is an adorable boy with a dark honey colored coat, a sweet sugar dipped muzzle, and gorgeous golden eyes. This lovable guy enjoys snuggling with his stuffies, riding in the car, and relaxing with his humans. He does well in his crate and doesn't mind sleeping in there at night. He is very friendly, but can take some time to warm up to new situations. Once he does, he's a happy boy with a tail that won't stop wagging. Duke knows basic commands and is crate/house trained. He does pull on leash so an easy walk harness is recommended. Duke is loving life at doggie day care. He is very loving and is having fun meeting new people and pups. He enjoys getting petted and has a great lab lean. :) He will actively seek attention from his people with a nose nudge. If you are sitting down, he will place his chin on your lap or put his nose under your hand to get affection. 

UPDATE FROM THE FOSTER: Duke is not shy at all. He is an in your face, happy-go-lucky, and go along all the time. He is a jumping bean (except he is BIG). He's full of energy, but happy to do anything for a treat or a toy! Duke loves all stuffiesâ¦ however, he loves to destroy them more. Do you have a lot of stuffies that need destroying? Duke is your guy.

Ginger is a sweet, smart, gentle lady who enjoys snuggling, swimming, and going for walks. This pretty brown-eyed girl has good manners in the house, sleeps all night in a cozy dog bed, knows multiple commands, and walks well on a leash. Sheâs pretty close to perfect! Ginger is a fun, active girl who doesnât need much and is ready to find a family that has room for a laid-back love bug in their lives. Sheâs generally fine to be left alone for about 6 hours, but she needs a home where she won't be alone for a long work day. There are just a few things Ginger canât do in her golden years - like stairs. Sheâs okay on a few, but a whole flight is too much for her. She also needs help getting into a car. Ginger LOVES to sleep in the bedroom. She gets along with all of the resident dogs, and even the resident cat. Sometimes she doesn't like to share her toys, so as long as there are plenty of toys to be had, she will be a happy camper! She has been learning to take treats gently and responds to \""easy.\"" She'll be a great addition to someone's home. She's such a nice dog with a great spirit and energy!Â 

UPDATE FROM FOSTER: Beautiful Ginger is checking in with a smile! Her foster family adores her and states that you cannot help but but smile and love her!! Ginger has great house manners, loves to go for walks, enjoys car-rides, is thrilled with lots of attention and will sleep quietly at your feet. All of these good things are wrapped up into a 13-year-old girl who is truly young in heart and spirit! gem of a gal who is always wagging her tail and is always excited to start her day, giving no thought or worry as to what will come her way -- A lesson to learn!! Ginger has so many good qualities and is good with other dogs who will respect her space - AND when she gets to know the kitty's in her life, she respects their space and won't chase or bother them. Ginger is not good on steps, but she has great house manners and knows all the basics. Added to this, she also has great eye-mouth coordination to catch treats, loves car-rides and lots of attention and of course mealtimes! All these good things wrapped up into a beautiful 13-year-old girl who is young in heart and spirit and has so much love to give!!

Just a petite bundle of stunning WHITE fur with little slivers of chestnut on the top of his ears. He stays clean too. He can be shy & even fearful of some humans or just lean into you as he melts to the floor with his belly up for affection. Because he can be fearful of \""some\"" people it's important to give him \""space\"" and go slow with introductions. He has met older children and enjoyed their calm attention but to help him with his excitability he prefers a home with older children. He has blossomed with positive dog training (no force, no fear, no pain) and build his confidence while strengthening your bond. Finn is seeking his human soulmate. He is an amazing young boy & is waiting patiently for the right home.

OTHER DOGS: Currently, if we can't avoid a dog during our walk, then we keep a safe distance like on the other side of the street, in a calm voice tell him he is a good boy, watch, & we toss a treat in the air for him to catch. We allow Finn to watch the dog, but break his stare with something positive to change the experience. This also helps him refocus his energies to something delicious. With \""some\"" dogs, this has worked well. There are still some dogs that he reacts to due to fear.  Finn tends to be intimidated by large dogs & can't help but want to chase small dogs, which is completely natural for Northern Breeds. He has met playful females and has done well with a slow introduction. He has also met some that made him fearful.  

INSIDE THE HOUSE:  Finn is calm inside the house as long as he gets a nice walk. We also give him a frozen toy filled with chicken broth & a couple of treats, which he loves to lick. Licking is very soothing to dogs & helps them stay busy. He enjoys chewing & licking toys. We always leave his crate open and he is kept in a gated area during the day, which is the kitchen as well as Finn's den. He is a very good boy & tries not to counter surf. He enjoys jumping on furniture & can learn which sofa is his spot.

BACKYARD FUN:  Finn enjoys your company while he runs around in the backyard. He enjoys keeping the garden free of critters, bugs, & eating fresh tomatoes off the vine. Thanks to Finn, the garden have survived! Finn hopes to have a fenced yard, so he can sniff and show you his zoomies, be your gardening assistant. He loves going outside & sprinting in happiness, especially in the winter!  He also loves to lay on his Kuranda dog bed under the shade after sipping water in between his own party in the backyard. He likes to play hide & go seek too. He also enjoys nuzzling his head in between your legs for affection in between his fun time. Just an amazing companion.   

Finn typically walks a mile 3 times a day. He sits nicely (with his paw up as if to say please hurry) for treats too. He has great potential & learns quickly too. The husky side of Finn is excitable. So it's important to help him practice calming down by asking for a sit, then a down, and then zen with long strokes on his back or a belly rub. He loves this & often melts into your side, then your feet with his belly up for love. In a new environment, it is important to remind him how to relax. He is a complete angel with his foster family, but they follow these guidelines earned his trust. He enjoys being with his foster family and is very affectionate. He loves to sleep on the bed & will initiate affection for a while, then goes to his side of the bed to sleep.  

TRAVEL COMPANION: Finn also travels well. He prefers to be seated close to his foster family. He is a family dog and loves with all his heart. 

TOYS & PLAY:  Finn likes squeaky tough toys (he destroys stuffed animals in seconds) and will trade his toy for a treat with no problem. He is quite playful & loves to smell & find things. He would do well-performing nose work. Finn enjoys being a \""good boy\"" & loves working for a reward. It's important to provide with Finn a calm demeanor and go slow to help him blossom. Finn likes to play the \""find it\"" game and he also likes to sit, wait, and catch a treat as you toss it in the air. He loves rotisserie chicken sandwiches, which he considers a high-value treat. We use it when counter conditioning scary things like dogs. 

SPACE: When introducing Finn to new things, we practice letting him go at his own pace and treating, repeat, etc. This has built his confidence. Trust is important for Finn. It is important to give him space and allow him to enter into your space when meeting him. Finn like most dogs does not like having his head pat by, especially strangers. 

We believe Finn is part Husky/Malamute, his Malamute side likes to keep his distance from other male dogs. His foster mom simply calls him and lets him sniff rotisserie chicken sandwich as she lures him to walk in a different direction (\""this way\""), he is rewarded with small bites. He responds nicely! He has so much potential. 

BACKGROUND:  Finn came to CHAAMP after living with a family on a farm with fur siblings. He was too interested in the chickens and the cats. He also wasn't getting along with the male dogs in the household. He was said to have high predatory behavior, which is normal for Northern Breeds. Finn can go from 0 to 70 in a blink of an eye due to excitement or if you go too fast and scare him. 

Finn's foster family has gone slow, provided structure, and practice positive dog training to help him make good choices. He is an amazing & affectionate young furry companion who loves his foster family & is seeking to fall in love with a special human.   

If you are interested in adopting Finn, please contact CHAAMP at CHAAMPapplication@gmail.com for an application. You may also complete an application online thru our web site, www.CHAAMP.org

Pepe weighs 35 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for adult-only homes.

Pepe is a fantastic lap dog with a soft shiny coat! He gives the sweetest kisses and loves to snuggle. This little guy is super smart and has learned some new tricks including up, spin, and paw. He loves to show off his skills in exchange for treats and praise, and he is always eager to learn more. 

Foster update:  Pepe has only been with us for the last 3 days, but he is a wonderful guest. His favorite thing to do is just cuddle with you on the couch. Second favorite is working on a bone, but he will put it down in a moment if someone comes into the room. Pepe doesnât touch a thing that doesnât belong to him and is housebroken to the max. He is crated for a couple hours a couple times a week to stay in practice, but there is really no reason to keep him crated- he would be a great buddy for someone who does work a full day since he can easily entertain himself. The most he barks is a single âWoofâ to tell the crazy dogs to go play elsewhere. He is a couch potato who insists on sleeping with his babies, which he sometimes carries around. Pepe is gentle with treats and stretches out a meal until the next one. He is great in the car, just occasionally panting. Pepe is also well behaved on leash and is doing fine behind a 4â fence. 

This dog is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people.  For now we are limiting placement to standalone, single family homes or townhomes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area.  As we learn more about the dogâs time spent in foster care, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment.

Pokie weighs 61 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Pokie is an exceptionally loving, sweet boy that adores all people and his toys. This silly boy has a toy on him at all times - so much so that we've had to teach him to check his toy at the door before he goes outside. Pokie has exceptional house manners. He is fully house trained and has full run of the house while we're out. He also loves going for rides in the car. Pokie is quiet and only lets out an occasional bark when there's someone at the door. Pokie is partially blind due to complications from diabetes, but he does see shadows and gets around just fine. He loves running around the yard and playing ball (he listens for the bounce and is quite good at locating it). His diabetes is well controlled with two injections a day that are quite easy to do. Pokie's other passion is food and he equates getting his insulin with a biscuit, so he eagerly sits in anticipation of getting his injection and treat. He would do well as an only dog or have a laid back doggy companion. No kitties. Pokie has so much love to give his forever family. He is such a sweet gentleman, LOVES people, toys and catching some rays. Pokie is mostly blind due to diabetes, but runs full speed around the house. He has excellent house manners and is a complete sweetheart. Pokie would do great as an only dog or with another super laid back companion. 

Foster family reports: Pokie is a wonderful companion. He loves to play with people and is getting along with the pack. Pokie adores everyone he meets and is very affectionate. Pokie loves to play ball (he tracks very well with his hearing). He is perfect in the house - he has never had an accident or gotten into anything he shouldnât. His thyroid and diabetes management have remained very stable. He would probably do best with a quiet doggy sibling or on his own.

My foster mom is helping me to become more confident everyday. I am getting used to people petting me and I love a good brushing! I am learning my leash manners and rides in the car. I think someday I would like a friend to play with but having you with me is good enough. Did I tell you that I love to snuggle and give kisses? Sometimes I even think I'm a lap dog. Although I'm very young and have alot to learn one thing you will have to teach me is how to love you Kai

Sonja is a 45 pound cattle dog / lab mix and she is about 3 years old. We have had her since March of 2016 because we were trying to keep her together with her mom, Momma Madre. After speaking with a behaviorist, we have decided to separate the two after having them for two years with no interest. Sonja is very shy in new environments and around new people. She tends to be somewhat insecure. However, within her own foster home, she is very extrovert and playful. Sonja would be a good pet for a quiet and calm family or person who has a regular routine. She would not make for a good road trip type of companion. Sonja enjoys her fosters backyard and she is very good at leaving presents at the door. Sonja is current on shots, flea / tick / HW preventative, fixed, and she is microchipped. Sonja does have Diabetes Insipidus which will require twice daily eye drops to be given. This is a lifelong condition but is easily manageable with twice daily eye drops. Date of Intake: 3/17/16, updated 6/23/18
Sonja is located in foster care in Maumelle. Meet and Greet appointments available! For more information, please email us at Dogs@Maumellefoa.org. Online adoption applications located at www.maumellefoa.org. Our adoption fee is $80. Included in the fee is shots, sterilization, microchip, dogs are given a dewormer at time of intake, placed on monthly flea/tick preventative, if heartworm negative then they are placed on heartworm preventative, if heartworm positive then they are treated once an adoption finalized.
We are always at the NLR PetSmart with our available pets on every Saturday of the month. From 10:30 - 3:00 ish.

2-3 year old Male beagle about 15lbs. Was found in a southern Virginia shelter by a volunteer. 

This dog tested positive for Ehrlichia before arriving to the rescue. Ehrlichia is a very common type of bacteria that infects dogs and other species and is spread by ticks. Ehrlichia is not contagious to humans or other pets. The only way to get this disease is to be bitten by a tick that carries it. The treatment is typically 21-30 days of antibiotics. This dog started treatment upon arriving to the rescue.

Chubbers is doing really well in his foster home. He has peacefully coexisted with the dogs he has met so far in his foster home. He likes walks and sure enjoys just hanging with his people. He needs slow introductions to new people to allow him to properly get to know visitors and greet them nicely. His foster says he has nice house manners. Does he sound like the perfect pup for you?

They lost their original owner suddenly to a stroke and were passed around to different family members for a few months. They ended up with the 80-year-old grandmother who was legally blind and taking care of her disabled son, so she didn't have the time or bandwidth to take on two young dogs. A family member reached out to Worthy Dog for help, and we gladly took them in.

The duo came to N. VA and were adopted in February by a very sweet couple, and we thought they had found their forever home. Sadly, their current mom, Lynn, who is only in her 30's, is going through a significant and unexpected health challenge, and suffering from kidney failure. She had a kidney transplant 18 years ago and was in great health when she adopted the pups. The couple was so very excited to have these dogs, and even started an Instagram account for Taco & Bell to share updates

About two months ago, Lynn's kidney started failing, and she ended up in the hospital for weeks. She is now on the transplant list waiting for a donor and has to do dialysis 3 to 4 days a week. She travels from VA to MD to a military facility for treatment, and the dialysis wipes out her energy when she gets home. Lynn has been the primary caregiver for the pups and had the flexibility to work from home. Her husband is active duty, and travels frequently, so he's not home during the day to help. Her mom and friends have been helping out, and kept Taco & Bell when she was hospitalized, but it's not a long-term solution.

In the interest of the dogs, Lynn has made the difficult decision to rehome them. She feels they aren't getting the time and attention they deserve, and with another transplant surgery in her future, she may be out of commission for an extended period. She wants to find a home for them before transplant surgery, and have peace of mind that they will be well taken care of. She is fostering them until a great family can be found.

TACO & BELLE

Taco & Belle have been together their whole lives and are a bonded pair. Taco is more timid, but loves his buddy Belle, and looks to her for reassurance. Taco needs a little more time to settle in and trust, but once he connects, he's very trusting and affectionate. Both dogs fancy themselves lap dogs once they get to know you.

This adorable duo loves to play and will keep each other entertained during the day. They are crate trained, enjoy their daily walks, and are potty trained, but do need regular potty breaks. Belle lets you know she needs to go out, and Taco will follow her lead once he settles in. Initially, Taco was prone to marking or excited peeing when he was unexpectedly picked up, but that was more about nerves. They used a belly band to settle him in, and both dogs have been trained on pee pads. Lynn will leave them gated in the kitchen when she goes in for treatment, and has a dog walker or her mom come in when she's out of the home for more than 5 or 6 hours.

These two pups are very connected, so we will only adopt them out as a pair. They are buddies who love to play and nap together and keep each other entertained. They are both afraid of loud noises and strangers and need time to acclimate to visitors, but once they know the person, like grandma, they are all excitement and kisses.

We feel a quiet, calm home is the best fit for them - an adult or senior couple, or empty nesters would be ideal. If you are looking for two little pups who will add joy and much entertainment to your life, please apply today. They are long overdue for their forever home.

Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to http://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.

Worthy Dog Rescue is an all-volunteer, foster-based rescue that primarily adopts to families in the DC Metro area."

I am a male Chihuahua who is approximately 3-4 yrs old. I am looking for my forever home. I get along with kids, dogs and cats. When you rub or scratch my sweet spot I like to talk, but it comes out sounding like I'm growling. I love attention but sometimes I don't like to share my food and will give you a warning growl. I love car rides, taking long walks in the sunset, playing with toys and love to play fight sometimes. My favorite thing is the world though is playing ball in the yard - I love to run after it and bring it back over and over! I would love to meet you! So please consider me for adoption and contact SHR.

Sometimes we will have more than one application on a dog. That does not mean it automatically goes to another family but you should be aware of the fact that until you are approved and set up for the meet/greet.. the dog could get adopted by another applicant.NOTE- OSCAR IS LISTED AS A COURTESY FOR ANOTHER RESCUE ORGANIZATION.

Iâm a boxer/pittie mix with a brindle pattern and I barely shed at all. I'm just over 1 year old and weigh about 60 lbs.  I have always looked at the bright side of life, even when I was just 10 months old, pregnant and homeless. I was still a very happy pup. I was blessed to be taken in by SOS where I was safely able to give birth to 8 beautiful and healthy puppies.  Now that theyâve all been adopted, I am hoping to find a wonderful forever home of my own.  I am great with kids (Iâve got natural mama instincts) but because of my size I'd do best with older, bigger kids. I'm young and still have a lot of puppy enthusiasm so I play too rough for little ones. I think other dogs are amazing to play with and  I'm a champion at Tug-O-War and fetch.  Iâll even bring my toys to share so that we can all have fun.  I am always up for a good snuggle.  Belly rubs and back scratches are appreciated as well.  I think cats are curious creatures. I love to chase and sniff them, but they never seem to understand I just want to play! Iâll leave them alone if you tell me to though.  I absolutely love, love, love to run (zoomies are the best!), but I could still use some work on leash training.  Iâve got places to go and trees to sniff!  But do you want to know whatâs even better than running?  Eating!  I havenât met a snack I didnât like... fruits, veggies, you name it!  And Iâll tell you a secret... Iâm willing to learn pretty much any trick in the book if youâre willing to share your burger with me!  I can be a bit skittish around loud noises like fireworks, thunder, big trucks, etc--- they can kind of freak me out.  But, during the last storm, my foster mom gave me a treat every time there was thunder and it didnât bother me so much after that.  Basically, if it involves food, Iâm up for anything!  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention I am completely house-trained as well.  I know I could be a perfect dog for your family; I bring a bit of extra sunshine wherever I go and Iâll love you unconditionally if you just give me the chance.  What do you say?  Is there room in your life for me?

The Canadian adopter had until Christmas to get him back here for HW treatment, and has not returned him, and has had the adoption fee returned, since he is coming back. So the rescue has a breached adoption contract, no adoption fee, no proof / paperwork from the other vet, or Mr Rebel. Who does this, refuses to get his HW treatment done? (IF Rebel is HW positive, he came here that way.)Since he has not been returned to rescue, he is a stolen dog. 12-2-17 Rebel has a meet and greet scheduled. 8-8-17 Rebel King comes into rescue as Senior owner surrender. (Both are seniors) The reason given was that the vet would not put him down, and it was suggested that he give me a call. The only complaint was that the dog would sometimes circle-growl-nip at the owner when he poured his coffee in the morning, until the owner went to his office.

I so wish I had him then. Flex will require a fenced in yard and quiet household where he can learn to trust again, at his own pace. He is NOT a bad dog, and with time and patience will be a faithful companion. Our adoption fee ($250) covers the age appropriate spay / neutering, heart worm testing, rabies, distemper combo, microchipping and any other necessary medical that a dog may need. Please consider a rescue that comes to you with all of the routine medical (and then some) already done.

7-9-15 Mya comes into rescue as an owner surrender, due to her being deaf and finding out after the fact that she is three legged due to an injury at 3 months old which the breeder did not treat. The owner did not know she was deaf when she got her, supposedly. So then, the rescue only gets part of the story as well. Then the paperwork and x-rays are withheld. It seems that FHO surgery was done at 8 months old. Yet, it did not heal correctly and no rehab was done. So, at 14 months old, the rescue had the FHO Repair surgery done for her. Finding out the morning of the surgery, that she also has a luxating patella, grade 4, which (according to that particular vet) will also need repair after the hip is healed. The rescue had two more opinions, after her FHO surgery, and both of those vets (who we have previously worked with and trust more than the one(s) who did the surgery) agreed that taking off the knee cap and reattaching (because of the previous neglect) could make her unable to use her leg at all and make it worse. Therefore, we are opting to let her be the dog as she is very happy now.

He is great with people of all ages (he sleeps with our 15 year old daughter or 13 year old son) BUT must be the only dog in the home.  He does do well with cats though.  If he has to go to the Vet's office he must be put on a short leash with a muzzle.  We have leashes, muzzle, harness, carrier that he sleeps in.  He is housebroken and if you are looking for a dog that you don't mind sharing a bed with, he's your dog.  He loves to be outside so a backyard with a fence would also be a must.

She had face full of porcupine quills. The owner was found and the she was surrendered. Roxie was adopted and went missing... only to be found 3 days later in the woods, porcupined again and very ill. She came back to ODAAT and has been in foster since. We were unsure what her future would hold. She had a bad leg injury that thankfully healed.
Roxie tolerates kids very well. She is extremely chill. A very relaxed, laid back girl
, she would probably do best in a home where she was able to be the Queen. She will attach herself to you immediately. She lays her head against your leg when standing and wants petted. She is most happy just to lay beside you. She loves to ride in the car and honestly... just be with you. We would not suggest cats for Roxie, but she LOVES stuffed animals. She acts like they are her babies.
The Perfect home we are looking for:
Family who wants a companion. A dog that will be dedicated thru and thru.
Family who has possibly one other dog that is laid back and does not care if they play.
Family who will give her all the affection and attention she so deserves.
Family that wants Roxie to be a part of their family. Her favorite place to be is on the sofa beside you... so if sofas are off limits... this girl is not for you.

He was origionally adopted from the Jefferson City facility, but ended up homeless in Millersburg. We took him in and found what we thought was a good forever home. Sadly, his new owner returned him to us for an act of very insignificant behavior, she didn't like.

One thing that has made it a little difficult to find Bowser another home is that he definitely does want to be the Alpha male, so there's a good possibility he wouldn't do well in a multi-dog household. He might, however, get along well, with one female, depending on her temperament.

Bowser's adoption fee includes his neuter, regular deworming, heart-worm testing, all vaccinations (Rabies is administered by a licensed veterinarian) and a microchip. For the specific amount of adoption fees or more detailed information, you will need to contact the Shelter directly please at 573 896-4049. Thanks for looking at Bowser."

I love other dogs, but my preference is dogs bigger than myself, and slow introductions are best!  I love people-not selective at all about them.  So what do you say??

Rusty is 3-4yrs old, weighs 50lbs and is located in Milton MA. He has  lived with kids as young as two and cats. He enjoys an active life with pack walks and doggie day care fun. And he is also happy hanging out and relaxing too!!. He has never met a person he didn't like. He enjoys good dog friendships but can be reactive on leash and takes his job of protecting the house from other dogs seriously,  So he needs a fenced-in yard.  An electric fence will not do .  He would enjoy a home with another dog to take the pressure off of having to protect it from all of those other dogs.  A  home that does not have many other dogs walking by would be good too..
So if you are looking for a great dog, good with kids, good with cats, good with other dogs  and enjoys life and you have a fenced-in yard and would expose Rusty to other dogs in the way he needs,

Name: Junebug

DOB: 11/7/2010

Weight: 75 lbs

Adoption Fee: $125

June Bug is a sweet senior and around 9 years old. She is an English Setter mix, weigh about 75 lbs. Do not let her age fool you, she is full of energy and would love for her forever home to have a big yard and humans with lots of time for walks and playtime. She will hop around like a rabbit when she thinks it is time to play, going for a car ride, waiting for her food, or when you are getting ready for a walk. If you tell her to sit, she will patiently wait for you. I have not heard her bark yet, even when somebody has pulled into the driveway or is knocking at the door. June loves to play fetch, play with toys, getting a good belly scratch, and just hanging out. June's perfect day would be taking a walk or playing in the yard, coming in for a treat and scratches, taking a nap, and doing it all over again. She does currently live peacefully alongside cats, kids and other dogs but would also be fine being the only dog.

She has a heart of gold and there is no doubt in my mind that she will make a wonderful companion to her new owner. She is highly intelligent, and has completed dog training (sit, wait, down, shake, and many more commands), crate trained, respectful during car rides, fully potty trained and will do just about anything for a good treat. She will not jump up on furniture without being told \""ok\"". Who can help me find my forever home?

Because many of our out of state dogs were at one time strays, it is very difficult to guess the breed of dogs, especially as puppies. We cannot guarantee the breed, nor how large they will be full grown.Please keep that in mind!

Hi There! My name is Tanner and I am looking for my forever family. I am just a little guy who has had a \""ruff start\"" but I am excited about life! I came to my foster home with my sister when our mom could no longer care for us at 4 weeks old. I have been learning all about how to be a good boy. Since i'm still a baby I am working hard on this potty training business and sleeping quietly in my kennel. My foster mom says that I have a super sweet personality. I am pretty chill for a puppy and enjoy being a couch potato sometimes. I live with two little girls and LOVE to play outside with them and go on adventures. We also have a BIG furry foster brother who we are obsessed with a love to climb all over him and play tug of war with him. He's teaching us how to be good dogs. I am doing really well walking on a leash too. I would love to meet you and see if I'd be a good fit for your family, just submit an application and my mom with contact you! If you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.

Hi there! My name is Ivy. I was found as an unclaimed stray right here in Minnesota. I am looking for someone to follow around and keep company. Im calm, sweet and lazy. My foster mom also says I might be a little overweight too and put me on a diet. I do well with dogs but not cats. I don't need to be kenneled, I promise I won't wreck anything when you are gone, but I do prefer you to not be away too long. I go potty outside, and bark at the door when I am done. I dont care to go on crazy adventures, I prefer to lay around all day and keep my eye on you. Ill keep an eye on the kids too, I'm very gentle with them. Oh, and if you have a home without lots of stairs I would like that best, im an older gal and a little chunky so that might be difficult for me.

Theo is a handsome young lab/husky/shepard mix. He is very protective of his family and therefore can be cautious around new people. He is a big boy, 55 pounds of long lean muscle. He is very strong and will jump up to greet you, so probably no small children. Theo is still very much a puppy and loves chewing (don't trust him with your shoes), running, playing tug, and having a good snuggle. He loves to play and roughhouse with dogs his size and larger. He's probably too much for smaller or older playmates. He has lived with dog savvy cats but will give chase if motivated. Theo requires a fenced in yard to get out all of his energy. He can jump over a 4-foot baby gate and is somewhat of an escape artist so you'll want to keep an eye on him. He doesn't mind sleeping in a crate but can break out if he's bored. He loves going on walks but pulls at the leash, so he could use some training in that department. He does better with a harness and would make an excellent running partner. He is completely housebroken and never has any accidents. He knows the commands sit, down, stay, and off.

Name: Rocko
DOB: 3/15/2018
Weight: 10
Adoption Fee: $400

Hi, my name is Rocko and I just joined my foster family (I am sitting in my foster mom's lap as she writes this!) I am a super sweet, constant shadow of a lap dog. I love giving kisses! I start off a little shy at first, but it takes me just a few minutes to warm up to my person; treats help! I pick a person but if they aren't home, I pick my second person, and so on. I would love to find a family of my own soon!

My foster home has dogs and cats, and I get along with everyone. I am very persistent to be on my person's lap so I should be the only lap dog in your home. I really like the bigger dog best. The dog my size is bossy and I don't like drama.

I love all people but the very young little people make me nervous if they go too quickly at me. I am very gentle with children but I will need adult supervision around the little people to make sure they go slow and are gentle with me. I am just a little guy so I scare somewhat easy and when I am scared, I growl and bark, which scares kids and I don't want the little kids to be afraid of me.

POTTY TRAINED: Schedule trained. I do my business right away outside. I am also wearing a bellyband because the other dogs in the home need to know I am here too! My foster mom says when I am consistently dry, I can take it off.

CRATE: I am learning to like my crate! It's my safe place and I get a lot of treats when I go in there! I will whine and bark for a few minutes until I can't hear you anymore and then I sit quietly or go to sleep. I am quiet when I hear you walk in the door, silently anticipating being reunited with you again! I am sleeping in my crate at night but I would much prefer sleeping with my person in a comfy bed.

CUTE QUIRKS: I love to burrow in blankets when I want to sleep :)

IDEAL HOME: Single family home as Rocko is pretty vocal in his crate at first. He gets loud for such a small dog so shared walls wouldn't work for this little guy. Someone who is home most of the time would be best for him. He gets very sad without his person. A family with older kids or a person/couple with grandchildren 5+ would be a great fit for him. He is very gentle with all children but should be supervised with children 5 and under if grandchildren are visiting.

Psssst! It's me, Owen! I'm the cutest little dog who is looking for my match!

Could it be you? Let's see... Are you a little cautious when meeting new people? Me too!! I don't know about you, but when I'm given some time to warm up & trust you, I will jump into your arms, hang on tight, and snuggle right in. Then we can go for adventurous walks, lovely Sunday drives, or hang out for a night of net-flixing together! I will give you kisses, wait patiently when you're busy, and be there for YOU at the end of a long day.

Ideally, I'd fit in perfect in a quieter home with less commotion. More submissive type dogs are A-OK as long as I can have a little space when I need it. I'd probably do fine with cats, too. I enjoy older, respectful kids who want to read to me or cuddle up & watch a show. I'd prefer to sleep in my human's bed but I can adjust to a crate, too. Do you think you could take a chance to get to know me? Then apply to meet me today! I can't wait!! YOU could be my match!!

Name: Khan
DOB: 01/01/2019
Weight: 45 lbs
Adoption Fee: $400

I'm Khan , a good boy who loves to be active!

My fosters say I'm super soft and love-able. I absolutely love my people! In fact, I sometimes feel magnetized to them and will follow them around the house because I really love their cuddles, pets, treats and reassurance. I am the best combination of couch potato and play buddy!

I love to play fetch and am quite fast!

I don't like being kept in a kennel - I love my freedom! But can be in my kennel from time to time when needed. I am pretty antsy to get out as soon as I hear any commotion in the house prompting me to let me know that my crew is home.

When it comes to new dogs, I could use a bit of a slow introduction to them so that we can get acclimated to each other. I do love to go to the dog park and hanging out with new friends in a neutral territory. However, being an only dog in my previous home, I'm still trying to figure out how to have friends in the same house and may not know how to play and/or initiate play without coming off the wrong way. This awkwardness is getting better as I learn more about my foster fur sibings!

I've been in a family my whole life and looking to continue that family life with a family who will love me a ton! I lived with kiddos in my past life and was recommended to stick to older kiddos as I can get a bit jumpy and also love to do zoomies which can get a little intimidating for a little one. I did spend most of my time with kiddos though and I absolutely love them!

I'm house trained, can sit on command (with treats available!) and am learning to lay down on command. My fosters say I'm smart and want someone who can continue helping me out with this whole training thing. I am very food motivated and eager to please so with enough structure, I will become the best I can be!

My biggest weakness; however, is the darn car. (I don't get how some dogs get excited about this.) I can get motion sickness easily so will often drool more than normal during the car rides to ease my anxiety with these darn tin mobiles. This subsides as soon as we stop and am able to see our destination. My foster parents have learned to just bring a familiar blanket for the car to lay on and an extra towel so I can dry off quicker.

I look forward meeting you and giving you all the kisses. Adopt me? :)

Hello,

Hey, it's me- Angell! I'm a 7 year old female rat terrier and I'm sweet as cherry pie! I am adjusting well in my new foster home. Though I didn't think I'd find myself in this situation, I'm doing A-OK! You see, I had a home, but I couldn't go with when my family moved.

I've been told by my foster family that I'm making quick adjustments. I love all of my foster fur siblings and my human kid siblings, too! I do best with smaller dogs if I have an option. And, since I can be a little afraid of loud noises and quick movements, I'd do best with kids 8 and up! I love to play twister with my human foster sister, & family game night is my absolute favorite! I enjoy hanging with my humans whenever I can. Don't get me wrong though, I have been doing just fine at home when it's only me & my fur siblings. Foster mom lets me stay out of the crate when she leaves, and I'm told I've been very well behaved. I do use a crate at night and hardly make a peep. If I had it my way though, I'd choose to sleep with a human while snuggled up & covered in warm toasty blankets.

I'm learning how to \""get down\"" and \""sit\"" quickly! Shhh, don't tell my foster mom. I already knew those commands before I came. I'm developing more and more self confidence every day, which is helping me so I don't get so excited and urinate a little at your feet. Oops, I hate when I do that!! I do know how to go outside to potty, and a schedule without long periods helps me stay on track. I know I can get there. I just need someone to trust in me and help me develop my strong side!

I've been told I'm an absolute sweetheart. I love meeting new people and exploring the land on leashed walks. Car rides are a plus especially if we stop for a yummy treat! I'm not a picky eater but I might have some food allergies so my foster mom might recommend a special food. It's no biggie though!

I hope you'll take a chance on me. In no time, I will give you a big kiss and you'll see from my soulful eyes, how grateful I am you chose me!

Hi! My name is Jack, but my foster mom renamed me to Kai and I'm still learning my name either way. I'm happy to be at my new foster home and am excited to find a forever home. I love to play with stuffed squeaky toys, and will bring them out and toss them around. My foster mom gave up picking them up because I just get them right back out again. There's another dog here too, she's cool. We play together and sometimes wrestle. I wish she would play with the toys with me but she doesn't much, but that's okay. There's two small people here too, they are about my height. I'm gentle and patient around them, but I get a little nervous when I'm sleeping.

I LOVE squirrels, they say I'm obsessed. They just look like lots of fun to chase. There is a cat here too, he keeps his distance from me, but I get really excited when I see him. I cry, bark, and whine; it makes my foster mom nervous I think. I would probably do best in a house that doesn't have cats, or with a very patient one and a family that would take LOTS of time with a slow introduction. There was also a small dog here for a few days when I first got here, I did okay with him. I'm just big and don't really know my size. I didn't hurt him or try to hurt him. We got along well enough. I'm not much for snuggles, but when I get tired I do sometimes lay next to my foster mom on the couch.

When I especially want attention I will go rest my head on my foster mom's lap and she will give me pets, when she stops I just flip her hand back on my head for more... it seems to work well.

I like to go for walks, but I tend to pull really hard. My foster mom put on an Easy Walk harness on me, and that slows me down some. She says I walk better with it on. I could use some training for manners, like sit, heel, come, stay, etc. My foster mom is trying and she started using a clicker with me with treats and when I'm in the house I love treats and like to practice with the clicker. When we are walking though, I don't care for treats, I just want to run or walk fast.

My family is at work all day so I'm in a kennel which is okay. I think I like the resident dogs kennel better as she has pillows, a super soft pad, and is covered with a blanket...it's kind of like a den.

I can't wait to find my forever family. Will you be my family? I'm good with kids, all dogs, and I might be able to learn to ignore cats. I like to be outside, and I think I'm going to like this cooler weather come a lot!

Hi everyone, my name is Maggie and I am a 4.5 year old pitbull. I'm a little girl that loves going for car rides and being with my humans. I love to give kisses to my humans. Something else I love? TOYS! I love toys, especially tennis balls. I do like to chew on them and sometimes they break, but I am learning how to be more gentle with them. I am crate and potty trained. I don't mind sleeping in my kennel and I even know the word. I like to go on walks, but because I'm so excited and a strong little girl, a harness works the best for me. Sometimes I need to take a break on the walk and flip down and scratch my back on the grass. My foster parents think it's pretty cute. I have a really big smile. When I'm happy you will know it because I tend to snort. I also love car rides and snuggling on the couch. You might have to help me up since I'm so short. I get along with dogs with slow introductions. I get excited seeing other dogs and my foster parents are working with me on this. I like to try and chase the squirrels so a home without little animals would be best for me. I am food motivated and already know tricks such as sit, stay, drop, and paw. I'm learning come and lay down and am doing a good job. If you love kisses, a cute smile, and an already trained doggy, then I'm your girl!

Name:Doorknob
DOB:06/03/2015
Weight: 15
Adoption Fee: $125

Hi there! My name is Doorknob but my foster family actually calls me Doorbell, silly huh? I can be a little distant with new people at first, but if you just give me some time I will be your partner in crime in no time at all! I am potty trained on a schedule, and crate trained if lead by a leash, score! I do really well with other doggy friends but sometimes prefer to just lounge around and coexist with them.I also live with a couple of these things called \""cats\"" in my foster home and do very well with them. When I was first rescued down in Louisiana,I lived with lots of other chi's in a home that had a fire. However, I came in well fed (maybe a little too well;)). I currently am fed in the morning and at supper time with the correct amount of food per the instructions on the bag. I am happy to say that I've been living a much healthier lifestyle these days and have shed most of my extra pounds after a lot of dieting and hard work! I am fed next to two of my fosters dogs and have been known to try and take their meals when they are not looking. My foster mom makes sure we all eat out of our own bowls so I go and pout until she says potty outside. Those words are my favorite because we all run for the door. I do better off leash and going to the potty so if you have a fence that is a bonus for both of us. I will go potty while on a leash too. I just prefer to run to the door and go straight out side. My foster will be trying a lead in her back yard, come spring time (if I am still here) and she thinks I will do well on that because I will get to choose where I go potty. I have quirks due to my past but am able to live with my foster mom and three human foster siblings ages 15 to 7 without issues. I taught them everything they know on how to take care of me so I feel safe. The fosters know my cues and are working with me everyday to get better and better at being a dog. I do love my blankets and do not like people taking them from me but will share with you once I get to know you and you have the right moves :) I do love to snuggle on my terms (when I want it). I am not fond of being picked up like a baby but my foster mom can show you how to pick me up the way I like it. I have been known to bug my fosters for pets and give them some kisses. My big human foster sister loves to sweep and I cannot stand the broom so I go to my kennel for cleaning time. I can be very playful when I'm in the mood to be and am also known to tell a good story or two (bark) while doing it or of course if that doorbell rings. If I am not in the mood I am usually on my blanket or yours. If you are good at reading dog cues and willing to give me some love and patience I would really like you to fill out an application for me. I really hope to have a family of my own, could that be you?

Hello,

My name is Buddee because I am my foster moms side kick. I am a little shy yet, so I really don't leave her side unless her daughters take me and cuddle with me. I just love to sit on their laps and get all the love I can and take my naps there every chance I can. I came to Minnesota with a bee sting and so I didn't feel good the first few days but my foster family took good care of me and now I am all better and playing like a puppy again. Tennis balls and crinkly toys are my favorite. I am still learning how to stand up to my sister who just takes everything from me. My foster mom says I need to stand up for myself, especially when it comes to breakfast, she try's to take my food. . I didn't know what love was until last week when I got to Minnesota and wow, is life good. My dog bed is so soft and comfy. My foster mom say I will have a family that will love me and spoil me, cause I deserve so much. I can't wait to meet them, she says I will win them over as I have the biggest sad puppy eyes and I can do no wrong. Well until I found the snack bin in her pantry and boy did those beef sticks smell amazing!
I can't wait to meet my fur ever family

XOXOX

Buddee

Eggroll (aka eggie) is an active little boy. He loves to play and loves his toys. He is good around other small dogs who like to play as well as big dogs who like to play . No children would be the best fit for him or older respectful kids. He likes to cuddle on his own terms. He can be protective of food so when feeding him he should be seperated from other pets and people. He has a spunky personality and deserves to have a good home where he can be spoiled and loved by a patient owner.

Eggroll is heartworm positive. He will need to be treated at one of the fabulous clinics Ruff Start works with in St Cloud or Duluth. Heartworm treatment consists of 3 injections in the pups back. Eggroll's first injection will be in roughly 30 days and the 2nd and 3rd injections happen 30 days after that. When a dog is going through heartworm treatment, they should be on \""restrictions\"" meaning a lot of lap time, crate time and always on a leash. Heartworm disease is NOT contagious, it is transported via mosquitos.

Hey! I'm Bridger. I've been told by my foster mama that I'm a sweetheart. I'm kennel trained and potty trained and love playing with toys (especially my peanut butter-filled Kong!) I really like running around in the yard with my two foster brothers (70lb American Foxhound and 40lb Sheltie), which is good since I'm a working breed dog and need to keep my feet (and mind) busy (in addition to being good with other dogs, I'm also friendly with cats). I am still a puppy and have tons of energy and like to do zoomies in the yard or sometimes in the house. My favorite thing in the world is food. I love it all and sometimes try to steal my human's food from their platesI'm working on improving my manners. I'm also working on not jumping up on people when I first meet them - my mom says I'm getting much better at this. I get along pretty well with the toddler in the house, but sometimes I don't know how big I am and knock her down. While I know I have things to learn, my mom says I'm smart and food-motivated, so I should pick things up quickly. My nickname around the house is Shadow since I follow my mom around everywhere - I just love being with my people and getting pets!

Hello, I am Shilo. I am a sweet older gal with LOTS of spring in my step. I really enjoy the outdoors and going for regular walks with my humans. I also love pets. In fact, I love them so much I will nudge your hand with my snout and toss your arm over my head so you get the idea that petting needs to happen. Sometimes even when you are napping I will wander over and lick your face to let you know it's time for pets. I do also like daily hugs from my people. I am a little bit of a space invader at times. I can't help it, I just think people are really great.

Along with my love for human companionship, I also appear to be cat and dog friendly. Although I must admit I am not always willing to share my things with other four-leggeds in the house. I am pretty quiet, but occasionally I will bark to let you know someone is at the door. I will also bark for a minute if you leave me home instead of letting me come along for a car ride. I am potty-trained and can be left alone to roam the house. I am also good in the car and walk nicely on a leash. I do know the commands of sit, down, come, and shake.

Even though I am a little older, I appear to be in great health. I have a little muscle loss in my lower back but this does not seem to bother me and it does not slow me down one bit. The vet just recommended some joint supplements to keep me feeling my best. My foster family says that I am super sweet, and have the prettiest teeth and fur around. Seriously, no doggy breath! Overall, I think I would get along well in just about any home, but may do best with older kids only because some of that young kiddo energy may be a little overwhelming. I am pretty furrbulous and am searching for the perfect family to call my own.

Hi! Hi there! HI!

My name is Linden (but mostly I go by Louie) and I'm the bestest good boy (or so I'm told). I'm looking for my furever home so here's a little bit about me:

-I've been treated for heart-worm already (I'm glad that's all done)

-I DO NOT like being in a crate. It's a no from me. I do well just being loose in the house with my puzzle ball or a toy to play with while you're gone.

-Everyone tells me I have the most beautiful blue and brown eyes (especially the girls at PetSmart)

-I LOVE to run around and frequently get the \""zoomies\"" which makes my foster mom laugh because my little legs go really really fast!

-I love to nap with my fellow dog roommate and show off my frog legs

-I'm slowly but surely getting used to adult men (sometimes I get nervous and bark so I just need you to tell me it's ok and introduce me slowly then I'll trust them and we'll be best friends)

-I have mini humans that I adore and that are my bestest friends who call me \""Lou\"" (I know how to be VERY patient with them because they're little)

-I'm very smart and need someone that is willing to continue to work with me because I'm still learning these things called \""manners\"" (who knew not everyone likes to be jumped on?)

-I'm still working on not \""marking\"" in the house and need little reminders every now and then because I still seem to think one corner of the wall needs to be watered occasionally..

-I need a fenced in yard to run in not only for my zoomies but because although I'm a good boy, I sometimes get loose and want to go on adventures by myself and my foster mom really doesn't like that....

-And above all, I need someone who will continue to love me for the goofy, meatball, love-bug that I am!

*Linden was recently treated for heartworm*

Name: Penelope
DOB: 7/24/2017
Weight: 31 lbs
Adoption Fee: $375

Hi! I'm Penelope! My foster mom calls me Pretty Penelope because I prance when I walk and I love it when she brushes me. I am a bit scared of the big city. I get anxious when cars drive by, especially buses, and sometimes the people on bikes startle me and I bark at them. I think I would like it better in a quieter neighborhood with less distractions. I do walk well on a leash, except when I see a squirrel or a rabbit. I just get so excited and I might pull hard, but I am working on that! My foster mom says I'm doing great and she even gives me treats when I pass by a squirrel without trying to chase it. I will chase a cat too, so probably best if I am in a home without those. I would love it in a fenced yard where I could run some more and stay outside for longer and just be my goofy self! Overall, I am just not understanding the apartment life and I don't think it is for me.

I am very shy and meeting new people is tough for me, so with that being said, I will need a family that is willing to be patient with me and help me build up my confidence! I might bark when people come into the house but I calm down when they make themselves small and sit on the floor with me. I like to follow my foster mom around, and I always need to know where she is and what she is doing. I like to lay in my crate, but I don't like it when the door is closed for too long, I might bark a lot and try to get out. My foster mom leaves me out now when she goes to work and I do just fine! I do a happy dance and wag my tail in half when she gets home. I can be alone as long as I have things to stimulate me - I love to have the music on and I love to find toys and treats that my foster mom hides for me. I do well with smaller dogs but can get scared of big dogs and I will need slow introductions to them. Sometimes I play a little too rambunctiously (working on that too!), so I will also need practice being around any small children.

Whenever I am scared, or just too overwhelmed, my foster mom pets me for a while and tells me it is ok and I feel better. I think this is why they say all you need is love! I know I will be such a happy girl when I am settled and I want nothing more than to learn to trust again and to be your companion for life.

Name: Sawyer
DOB: March 2018
Weight: 50lbs
Adoption Fee: $350

Sawyer is a typical happy, curious Pitbull tween. Just over a year old, he has all muscles and a puppy brain. He is silly and playful, he loves shaking and squeaking toys. He is strong with a short attention span. He tries to obey; He has been through basic obedience, he knows Sit, Down, Stay and Kennel but he is very easily distracted. If you are working with him and giving him directions he tries to please you. If you blink, he is looking for the next adventure.

He likes people and after a good outing, walk, or game of chase, he would like lay on the couch with you. Sawyer likes other dogs. He lives with three different dogs; he is respectful of the older, crabby dog. He tries to get the shy dog to play. And he plays and wrestles hard with the other large pup in the house.

He is curious about the cat but not obsessed. He sleeps in his crate and likes going for walks. He likes to swim and fetch in the water but he sinks like a rock and would benefit from a lifejacket.

Though he is still learning (he is impulsive), he is good natured and not aggressive. Sawyer is a joyful, powerful, goofball who would excel with continued obedience training and positive directions from the humans.

Hi my name is Zoe and I am a former Ruff Start Rescue dog who was returned due to no fault of my own. I am a older dog, eyes alittle cloudy, hearing not so hot, move kinda slow, but I do like to go for walks, just like to take my time. Sniffing is very important. I would be a perfect candidate for a senior to adopt me. I am very sweet, like people and other dogs, there is a cat at my foster's house, which I have never bothered. My foster mom and dad have taken me to the park, and I am a great car rider, just need to be helped in and out of the car. I am a quiet dog(soft barker), have a low key personality, house broken, will sleep with you on your bed or in a dog bed on the floor, if on the floor, I like a bed that is really cushy. Mealtime is one of my favorites, treats a must, chewies are good, but toys are not too interesting. Oh, and I like a good scratching and plenty of hugs and kisses. A fenced yard would be great, since my vision and hearing are not the best and sometimes I don't pay attention to where I am going. Oh, and another good thing, Ruff Start Rescue is getting my teeth cleaned. How great is that!

Name: Reese Puppycups
DOB: October 2017
Weight: 60lbs
Adoption Fee: $400

My name is Reese Puppycups! I came into rescue when I was just a little puppy and after a short time I was adopted. I lived in a family with another dog and kids and loved them all very much. My family says I am super affectionate, loving and cuddly (think giant lap dog) with those I know and my canine buddy too. I am uncertain of strangers whi approach my family at times so I need someone devoted to being my leader and socializing and training me in that regard. While I lived with another dog, I was kind of the boss in that relationship and am less certain whether I want new animal friends so a home without other pets would be best for me. I know that sounds like a lot of 'must haves' but for the right family I will be the absolute best companion you could ask for. I will be the most devoted friend you'll ever have.

Meet Bessie! When she originally came in, we thought she was about 6 months old but after a recent check up with the vet, they mentioned that she is likely closer to 1 year. She is 90% potty trained. Shy around new people but will warm up to you with patience. She is Not a fan of the busy city life, definitely does better in a more quiet environment. Gets along great with all dogs, and she finds other dogs help her build her confidence as well. Loves being outside amd going on adventures in the country. She has a prey drive and could be a good hunting buddy with some training. Still in the chewing stage but she is your typical lab puppy I find her smart and a quick learner just needs some training. She will cuddle on the couch with you and lay around the house when not a lot going on. She is kenneled trained. This little girl is in need of someone who can show her what love and patience is for she has had a rough start but such a sweetheart.

Name: Donnie
DOB: 2/05/17
Weight: 50#
Adoption Fee: $350

Donnie was found on the side of the road on the Pine Ridge Reservation this past winter. He had been trying to make it on his own for far too long in the extreme cold temperatures and was picked up as a popsicle! He was treated for hypothermia and is now safe and warm in his foster home. He is about 50 pounds, our guess is that he is about 2 years old, as he has pearly white teeth. He is the sweetest boy ever. Despite his big head and large size, he fully commits to being a lap dog! He LOVES to cuddle with you on the couch. He is gentle to kids of all ages and gets along with dogs of all shapes and sizes. He really is just a total lover and does not have a mean bone in his body. He took a bath without making a fuss and gets right into his kennel when asked to. He just wants to please you and hear you tell him, \""he is such a good boy\"". He is learning about life inside a home and also working his potty training. He loves treats and will be easy to train as he is food motivated. He has already learned that when he hears the fridge door open, he may get cheese if he sits really nice and waits. Donnie really is an all-around awesome dog, with so much love to share.

After lots and lots of tests... Donnie has a diagnosis. He has Reflex Dysnergia. meaning his urethra does not relax at the same time that his bladder contracts, making urination and emptying his bladder impossible at times. Having had this condition for so long his bladder has become distended and 4X larger than it should be. He will require catheterization likely a few times a month to drain his bladder. I did it last night (I'm totally not a vet)... he lays so still and knows relief is coming.

There has to be a home for him? Someone who can manage his condition? He's such a sweet boy!

Name: Pierogi
DOB: 7/24/2010
Weight: 6 lbs
Adoption Fee: $125

Hi there! My name is Pierogi! I am said to be a spunky, older gal that like to dance. I am potty pad trained but will go outside too if you take me out. I may be an old dog but I can definitely learn new tricks so potty training shouldn't take much training. I love to play with other dogs and I will tolerate a cat so I can fit into almost any household.

Name: Winston
DOB:6/24/2009
Weight: 14
Adoption Fee: $125.00

Sir Winston, as his foster refers to him as, is the cutest little guy with a cute little under bite. Winston is a happy little guy that loves to be kissed on his head, to be held and told he's a good boy. Winston loves to watch out the window, he will bark when he see's something that interests him outside but mostly he just loves to sit quietly looking out. Winston loves to have his own place to lay, loves adventures and loves to cuddle. You can't help but smile when looking at his little face filled with character. Winston is interested in the cats here, he is respectful, but he does like to play with them. He's super smart and is so fun to have around.

Ellie and Winston are bonded, where one goes, the other follows, they are in love and watch out for each other, and will only be adopted together. Neither dogs would be good in an apartment setting, they do bark when they hear a noise outside and when they get excited, which we're working on, outside of that, they're pretty quiet. Both dogs do really well being groomed and actually enjoy it. They are both sweet hearts and they're a joy to be around. They're looking for a quiet retirement home, with a person/people that enjoy walks and just hanging out. They ride great in the car, so they'd be good little travel buddies. Both dogs are good with all animals and people and both are potty trained. Winston may initially try to \""mark\"" as he did when I first got him, but he quickly learned not to, using the word \""NO\"" when caught in the act consistently, that, that is not ok and has stopped in the house. These 2 are little treasures and are a joy to have a round

Miss Ellie as her foster refers to Ellie as, is a beautiful, loyal, loving little lady, that loves to be where you are.

She is vocal, when she wants a treat, wants to go out or if you just want to have a conversation with her, she'll be happy to do this with you. Ellie has very few teeth and will need soft food.

Ellie loves walks, laying in a soft bed or just hanging out and she absolutely loves to be pet, getting and giving kisses and hugs. She is a joy and comfort to have around, especially when she lays next to you.

biName: Bindi
DOB: 04/12/18
Weight: 45 lbs
Adoption Fee: $350

Bindi is an adventurous spirit who would love to find someone to explore the world with!

A good-natured, playful, friendly young adult dog, she likes going for walks and is athletic despite some injuries to her hindquarters early in her life. Bindi has been seen by a neurologist, who informs us that she may have had injuries near her tail. She can feel her legs and has good muscle tone but will need to wear diapers for life. Her foster home is working with simple exercises and stretches, and Bindi is also taking proin to help her build strong bladder muscles. Her perfect family will be home most of the time, will be prepared to continue working with her, and won't be overwhelmed by her diapers. Bindi lives in a foster home with two other dogs. She wrestles with her foster brother all day and is very bonded to him although doesn't always like to share her toys. She would love to have a dog companion in her new home. A home without cats would be best, and because she is a herding dog, a home without small children would be best, too. Bindi travels well kenneled in the car and is learning all sorts of new things, like sit and down and jumping onto things (to help build strong muscles). If you have an active family who likes outdoor activities, Bindi may be the perfect dog to share your life with.

Name: Jera
DOB: December 2018
Weight: 35lbs
Adoption Fee: $400

My name is Jera and I just joined my foster family about a month ago so they are still learning a few things about me. I'm definitely on the shy side of the spectrum. You might say I'm a wallflower. I had a best friend in the shelter and she was a very brave dog who I could trust to lead me to nice people. Now in my foster home it's clear that I'm absolutely amazing with dogs, from the boss lady to the 60 pound dopey male, to the fun-police chihuahua. Im still shy with people, especially new people, but if my canine friends race up to greet new people I'm sure to follow. Sometimes I even give new people kisses. My perfect forever family would include at least one other confident social dog that I can learn from, a quiet home with adults or older teens only, walks with my family, and lots of time lounging outside in the sun or shade. My new family will just need to be careful to never let me escape through a door or gate off leash because once alone they may not convince me to come back right away just because new situations are scary. With time, experience meeting nice people, and patience, I know I can learn to be brave. Sometimes I get brave enough to sleep on my foster mom's lap already. I'm very quiet in my kennel, share things with dogs and people nicely, give gentle kisses, and am currently working on understanding this word \""sit\"". My favorite things are walks and playtime with other dogs. I'm a quiet shy girl, so I might not be for everyone, but my foster mom says that for the right family I will be the perfect love of their life because I'm the sweetest little girl who never does anything bad. As they learn new things about me they will fill out more information.

Name: Mickey Mouse
DOB: 4/20/13
Weight: 35lbs
Adoption Fee: $325

Hello, I'm Mickey! My age is just a number, I can run with the young dogs! In fact, I LOVE running! I think I'd also love to join you on long walks or hikes! Since I'm a working breed, I love having a job (already working on my fetching skills) so an environment that stimulates me is ideal. Since I'm food-motivated I could learn all sorts of new tricks! I'm very eager to please so positive-reinforcement training is great. I like other dogs as long as I have a chance to get to know them properly first but at the end of the day, I love people! I'm a A+ snuggler and I'm not afraid to get really comfy with you on the couch. You'll know when I'm really relaxed because I go belly-up and start snoring with a smile on my face!

My ideal family would be one that has a yard I can run around in, will shower me with affection, take me on adventures and snuggle me at the end of the day. I need slow intros to other dogs and men. If my future family has kids, it would be best if they were older kids who have good dog manners. Unfortunately, I can't live with cats due to my drive to chase them. Thanks for checking my aPAWrable face out!

Are you checkin' me out? My name is Laika.

My foster mama thinks I'm beautiful and just the right size. I'm a 20# tricolor Jack Russell terrier/terrier mix. I'm about 3 years old. I am extremely shy when meeting new people or new situations. I like to have a hiding spot or 2 to run to for safety but come out again if it's safe. If you are willing to be patient and let me learn to trust you, you will find that I will follow you from room to room and might snuggle up on your lap. I love to curl up right next to my foster mama at bedtime too! I get along well with other dogs. I love mealtime and treats are always welcome. I have no info on cats for me, but I am good with kids as long as they don't poke my eyes or anything crazy!

I might do better in a home with a fenced yard because I really don't like my leash. I will be brave enough to meet you if you would like to meet me!

Please note my forever home must have another pup friend living there.

Laika arrived heartworm positive and has completed treatment.

STOP!! Help me! I need a family of my own. My name is Tate and I am sooo excited to be looking for my forever home. My ideal home would be an active family, I have a lot of energy to burn so a running or biking partner would be amazing, I mean really cool. Fetch can be so over-rated, I would much rather be next to my human than chasing a ball yards away from them.

I am crate trained (I actually love having my own space) and I am potty trained. I walk really nice with my fancy no pull harness too! My foster mom says that I am very eager to please so training is going ok! She also said I am a lap dog and I love to give kisses...Gee Whiz! What can I say? I'm a lover not a fighter!

I am working on my manners, my foster mom has been working very hard with me and is making sure I am on my very best behavior when I meet my new family. I have mostly been working on my jumping and mouthiness, sometimes I just get really excited to meet new people and I totally get all crazy.

I really like other dogs, but would do best with ones who are my size and love to play a lot. My foster siblings are not super thrilled with my young pup energy. I would do best with older kids as I have not quite figured out my body yet and may knock them over unintentionally.

Well? Are you ready for some fun? Do you need someone to keep you motivated to exercise? Fill out an application and my foster mom will get in touch :)

Hiya! I'm Martha! I'm an adult Rottie mix looking for a family who is willing to help me learn, grow, and be the best girl I can be!

I love playing with toys, going for walks, and getting pets. Playing tug is by far one of my favorite things to do and playing with my foster siblings, it fills my whole day! I love going outside and am learning pottying outside is where I'm supposed to be! It's going very well and treats really help me learn. I take them so gently I lloovvee treats.

When my Foster Mom asks me to sit, I sit right then and there. I listen very well and I am extremely attentive to her! I come to my name, I stay close when we are outside, and if I need to be on a leash I walk fine on that too. I still need some help in other departments but I am a very quick learner!

I can get a little nervous if people I don't know reach for me. I growl and ask for my space. My Mama says Rottie's tend to be trust based and folks I don't know reaching to grab me makes me anxious. I warm up quick, but my future family should be aware of this.

With training and proper exposure, this isn't really even noticeable in my foster home. I love my Mama, my Dad, and her human siblings! They're 16 and take care of my some days. We play, wrestle, and cuddle.

What do you think? Can I come home with you?

Weight: 60lbs
Adoption Fee: $350

Hellooooo! My name is Vinnie and boy am I ready to find my forever home! I am a young buck who enjoys going for walks and hiking with my foster family. They tell me I have quite a bit of puppy energy still and need a daily outlet for it. I am working hard on not jumping up when I get excited to see someone, I am told I would do best with older kids so I do not accidentally knock the little ones over. I am really happy to meet everyone though: men, women, kids, and I greet dogs nicely with an invitation to start play. I have not been exposed to things called \""cats\"" yet, I am not sure if I like those or not and should have slow introductions to any that I meet. I am crate trained and sleep through the night in my kennel, I am not always thrilled about going in but will reluctantly go in if there is a treat in their first. I will bark at people outside who are walking past the house, but who wants a hound dog that doesn't bay like a hound? I am told that apartments may not be the best place for me though. I love riding in the car, I actually just took a road trip to Denver with my foster mom and I did amazing!

I also love, love, love to play! Toys, bones, the occasional non-dog toy if I get too excited so I still need to be supervised to make sure I am chewing on dog friendly items. I am getting much better with my potty training, I will need to be kept on a schedule as I will have an accident if I am not let out in time. I do try to ask though so I am sure we can work out some sort of agreement on that one.

If you are ready to add a spunky, energetic and playful young man to your household, I am definitely the one for you!! Please consider putting in an application so we can meet and be best friends forever :)

Hi there! My name is Jelly Beaners - but you can call me whatever cute name you'd like because I am deaf! I recently joined my foster mom and she has fostered a few deaf doggies and she said I'm one of the easier ones! I do good in my kennel and I potty outside! I am working on remembering to look for my foster mom. Sometimes I forget to watch her if she wants me to come inside - but I'm working on it! I am young and have a lot of love to give and lots of things to learn! If you have questions or are interested in me, please fill out an adoption application at www.ruffstartrescue.org.

Name: Toby Jacob
DOB: 03/29/2006
Weight:17lb
Adoption Fee: $125

Toby Jacob AKA Toby joined Ruff Start Rescue after his forever owner passed away unexpectedly and the family was unable to afford his medical needs. He is affectionately known in his foster home as Toby Shark as well. He received that nick-name because when he first joined their home, he would walked around the house and make funny gremlin noises and would look up at them and bark with his teeth hanging out from his under bite. Toby is a super laid back gentleman and enjoys being with his humans and foster brothers all the time. Toby LOVES to eat, but does have skin allergies and requires a grain free dog food. He prefers a Raw Diet or wet dog food over dry kibble. He will play with stuffed animal toys from time to time, and loves playing tug-a-war with his foster mom when he gets in the playing mood. Most of his day though is spent resting (snoring) and following his foster mom and companion foster brother (Shih-Tzu) around the house or at the grooming salon that his foster mom works at. Toby does have separation anxiety and will need a home where he will either have someone home with him most of the time or will be able to join his family to work every day. Toby suffered from severe dry eye and extreme ear infections in both ears for an extended amount of time before joining Ruff Start. He ended up having his ear canal removed in his right ear and also gets multiple eye medication in both eyes twice a day now to help with his dry eye. Due to the severity of his ear infection, his facial nerve on that side of his face was damaged in surgery and he can no longer blink his right eye and his jowls are droopy in that side of his face. He does receive eye medications to help keep his eye healthy. Toby is mostly blind and deaf. He will need a one level home so that he will not fall down any stairs. Toby is house trained and enjoys strolling around the yard in the warm weather. He does need frequent potty breaks just because he has a harder time holding his potty because of his age. Toby grew up with multiple other large and small dogs and has interacted with cats in the past. In his foster home, Toby actually has a little shih-tzu that he uses a lot as his seeing-eye companion. He follows him around to make sure he is not going to bump into anything as well as his friend keeps in away from wondering off in the yard. He may do best in a new home that has another small laid back dog that he can bond with. Toby is good with children, but will need kids that understand not to be in dogs faces and not to be over bearing. Toby is all up to date on all his main vaccines, is neutered and heartworm negative. However, Toby has tested positive and has been treated for Lyme's disease. Lyme's disease can cause joint stiffness and minor lameness from time to time, his foster home gives him a daily joint supplement to help prevent this as well as to help with any arthritis he may have. Toby also has what is commonly called \""Old Dog Lung\"" which is calcium build up in his lungs. It causes him to have difficultly breathing from time to time and may require further medical intervention in the future.

Toby's Needs

- Eye ointment in the AM and PM

- Eye Lubricant in right eye 4-6 times a day (as needed)

- Companion Animal

- Owner who is home most of the time or can bring him to work for frequent potty break and separation anxiety

- Frequent medicated baths for skin allergies

- No Stairs

- Grain free dog food

Name:Rosie
DOB: 8/11/2007
Weight: 80 lbs
Adoption Fee: $125.00

Meet Rosie, a year nine old Lab with lots of love to give! She's a bit on the chubby side at 80 lbs, but we are working steadily to get her weight down.

She's potty trained and has never been kenneled inside the house. She likes to hang around with her people and would do okay without having a fenced yard after getting used to her new home! She loves absolutely everybody she meets and still likes to play with her two younger housemates. Due to being a little overweight, Rosie moves a little slower and breathes heavy after exercise but she does quite well with a halter and leash. As she ages, her eyes are sadly getting cloudy and she can't see as well, but that does not take away from her loyal and loving personality. She is a total sweetheart, stays close by your side, and would be a real asset to any family with a more sedate lifestyle! She loves her kongs, marrow bones, belly rubs, squeaky toys, and don't forget her beauty sleep!

Due to Rosie's age, she will likely need to be on daily medications for the rest of her life. Her new home should be prepared to cover that cost. Rosie also struggles with stairs, especially after her old hips wake up in the morning! She would do best in a home where she does not have to do more than 2-3 stairs at a time.

Adoption Fee: $350

Hi! I am young dog looking for my forever home! I am a super energetic and would love a family that wants to do activities! I'm very food motivated which is awesome for training. I crate very well, especially over night and for short times during the day. My effervescence can be over whelming for dogs so I need to be with dogs who wont be upset with my energy or be the only pet in the home. I do well in a fenced yard since I love to run and play all day! Older kids would be great so I can keep up with them. I'd knock over anyone under 10. I love smart puzzle toys to keep my attention, especially when they dispense treats.

I am physically fit, very smart and food motivated. My foster moms thinks I would do great with a fun job/ sport like
dog agility, dock diving, disc dog etc. Do I sound like the boy for your family??

Name: Dacotah
DOB: 12/05/2013
Weight: 51 lbs
Adoption Fee: $125

A good day to you! My name is Dacotah and I am an adult Husky mix looking for a human companion. I would consider myself a refined gentleman, I love long walks, hanging out with folks, and cuddling when the day comes to a close. Once in a while I will play with my younger foster siblings, but they can be so jumpy! I do prefer dogs whose taste more a lines with my own. Trying to talk to them doesn't get me anywhere so I find myself a good spot on the couch, curl in a ball, and plop right down to watch some tele.

I get along with pretty much everyone, I am very easy going. I like dogs, I get along with the resident cat, and children don't bother me either. I would prefer more respectful children if I am going to live with them for as I get older, I am more easily startled. I also like talking about my day, current affairs, all the like, so it can be off putting to younger ones if they aren't ready to chat with me. Another reason I prefer more mature small humans. They love talking to me!

I also like to play with toys! I love ball and tug ropes, so if you like playing I'd love if we could toss the ol' pig skin around. When I was a younger man, I moved a lot faster so you'll have to take it slow to start but once I get on a roll I'll play with you for hours!

This last part I am going to let my current human talk to you about; I don't fully understand why I get nervous about certain things so maybe she can help explain what I'll need. She does a great job of watching me so I bet she knows what will be best!

Hi there! My name is Taylor and I am Dacotah's current foster Mom. He has done an awesome job telling you about himself and covering the things he is so good at! Now I want to talk about something any new family considering Dacotah will need to know moving forward. I'm going to tell you where he came from, why he is the way he is, and what you can expect applying for him.

Dacotah's previous owner came on hard times but did what he could to continue to care for his pup even after they became homeless. Dacotah and him lived out of their car and they shared everything, from food, to water, to a living space. For this reason Dacotah is not used to confinement and is not accustomed to being alone. Being an adult dog, around 5-6 years old, these traits are something I find to be a part of him, not something I need to train away. I am looking for folks who are home more often than not and will have to leave him home for maybe a max of 2-3 hours a day. He does need a special type of kennel and this is something that his potential home will want to research prior to applying. It is called an Alcatraz kennel and it is made to be unescapable as the name may imply. Left out he can hurt himself and possibly your home if he becomes nervous or scared. This is not something that I as his foster parent take lightly. Watching him shake and cower away from me if I need to kennel him is crushing. Which is why I am looking to find a home that won't require that of him. He doesn't require a lot of exercise or grooming, just a lot of love! If you have the ability to bring a dog to your place of work or work from home, he would be an amazing match. He listens to commands extremely well and is a very people oriented dog that really looks to you for support. Any applicant's will need this information and I promise you, should you be able to meet these requirements, you'll come to meet one of the sweetest, gentlest, nicest dogs I have had the ability to foster.

Thank you for your consideration, Dacotah says he is excited to spend his life with you. Ready to go?

- Needs to be only pet in the home

- No children in the home

Woah! Like, hey man! I'm Reynold! My foster Mom calls me Renny, it's nice to meet you.

I am a big baby, literally, as I'm about 75lbs. I love playing with toys, I get the zoomies, I jump over couches and stairs, I tuck my butt and I RRUUNN all over my yard! I am learning to drop balls and toys, I also love going for walks! I have a back pack I wear and know when it's time for work!

My past isn't really known, I came to a vet clinic and was in pretty rough shape. I know it says at the top I can't be with other dogs, but I might be! My foster Mom is being very careful with my introductions to make sure I don't hurt myself, so only time will tell.

In that same breathe, she does know I'm a very smart boy! After I'm all played out, I like laying in my dog bed and I chew on my bones. Training will be super important for me, since I am a big boy I could very easily hurt someone if I don't respect and listen to my family. My Mama knows that too. She'll be very picky about the family I go to and they'll need to have had bully's in the passed to have me.

I don't want to surprise you, but I can be kind of pig headed! I won't be a good first dog. I will be a challenge, but a challenge that will reward you many times over. I love being with people and I am so happy to be alive and just.. AM SO HAPPY! MY SMILE IS HUGE AND I WANNA PLAY WITH YOU!

What do ya say? Up for it? I'll get my back pack, let's go!

Well, hello there! My name is Zooee and boy, am I glad you stopped by to see me!

I'm a sweet, young girl waiting to find my forever home. I'm a typical puppy - bouncy, playful and so eager to see and do everything!

With my young age, I would still benefit from continued training, but I am a smart girl and am so eager to learn new things.

I do well with humans of all ages; I have plenty of kisses to give! I'm being fostered with other dogs and I do well with all of them. They are a little lazy compared to me, so I would really love to find a playful companion or an active family.

Do you think you could be the family I'm searching for?

Hercules and I were taken in by Ruff Start after ended up at the shelter, and oh boy are we adjusting well to home life again. I can be left out overnight or while my fosters are gone, I do not get into anything. I am curious about the other dogs here, but they are young and wild. We sniff each other when we get ready to go outside. I am good at going potty outside, but do rely on being taken out on a schedule. I do need to be let out right away in the morning because I am not able to hold my bladder as long as I used to! I have lived with cats in the past and children. I am low key, but I like to walk outside. I am eager to please and love affection. At times I can be protective of my toys if other dogs, not Hercules, try to take them.

I am missing my left eye, but my foster family say how handsome I am and it doesn't affect me at all. They do not know how I lost my eye. .

This animal is part of our \""Seniors for Seniors\"" program where we offer senior animals adopters an opportunity to adopt a pet at a discounted fee.

Hi there! I am an older gentleman. I can not hear very well, but my foster family still loves talking to me. I like to be around more mellow dogs. I've met the younger generation here at my home, and they can be a little wild, sometimes I have to bark at them to back off. I do get along with the other senior dog here. I haven't been around cats, and I think older kids would do best for me. I like to lay in front of the heater on a nice blanket. I am working on potty training, my foster takes me out every couple of hours. My foster says that I need to take treats a little nicer. I do like scratches, and sitting in my fosters lap. I also like to play with my stuffy and show my foster my toys. Sometimes I can be a little selfish with my toys and don't like the other animals to take them. Really the only time I bark is if another dog takes my toys or when my human people are in the kitchen cooking and would like some of their food.

Name: Scooter
DOB: 08/10/2014 estimated
Weight: 54 lbs
Adoption Fee: $325

Life is hard on the streets, especially when you look like I do. I'm an adult bully mix who is muscly, likes to growl, and likes to show my teeth. You'd have to stay with me a little while to see that's just my smile. To see my white muzzle. To see what I've been through. I've decided to call myself something approachable, I want to appeal to a wide amount of people. Call me.. Scooter!

I was found as a stray and brought into MACC, where folks at first weren't sure how I would do. As previously mentioned, I can come off as kind of hard. Then they let me out to play with some others dogs and.. well, I got to be me. I like playing with other dogs a lot but I like to meet my new friends slowly to make sure they're cool. I need to feel acclimated before I'm willing to offer friendship. The streets taught me that. I'm also kind of pushy, but I've been told most bully's are like that! (You may notice a reoccurring theme as I am pushy in some other departments too) I tend to play with my whole body so little children most likely will not be a good fit for me. Think, bowling ball. (See, pushy)

I met a kitty at my permanent foster home. She is a small creature, who stands her ground. I find her frightening and attempt to sneak up and sniff her when she isn't looking. This task is more difficult than it appears as she is very fast and harms my nose if I get too close. I bark at her. Then I hide. When she rests, I am respectful of her space. I do like her, although I have yet to confirm how she feels about me.. given the scratches on my nose, I would say she needs, possibly, more space? Will make a note for the future. (Too pushy?)

I would like to talk to you about how my true life's obsession. The thing that gets me up and out of the kennel in the morning, outside even when it's raining (I hate rain. I. Hate. It. It's too pushy), what even motivates me to listen to the humans I live with! It is the soft sphere they call, a tennis ball. This object is an amazing thing, I put it in my mouth and squeeze, it makes a sound that makes me JUMP with joy! I bring it to one of my humans, they are so silly they have no idea its value! They THROW IT! I bring the precious gem to them, only for them to do THE SAME THING AGAIN! These fools, eventually I stop bringing it back and just enjoy my ball alone.

I mentioned in the beginning of my tale, that I can be a tab quirky. That is a very true statement and my possible new humans will need to know these things about me, I find honesty is always the best policy. The streets taught me that.

I am a bed hog.

When I get on the bed, I roll around all over it first.

I snore really loudly.

I don't always listen when you tell me to drop the ball. (You're just going to throw it! You don't even know its worth!)

Sometimes I get really excited and pee a little. Just a little, I swear.

I drool when we play ball. That isn't a little. It's a lot.

I play in the water bowl. Only sometimes.

When you push me, I will push back against you with all my might. Even if I can see what you're trying to make me do, is definitely the right choice. (It's a bully thing, or so I've heard.)

I am scared of new people. I need you to take things slowly with me. When I was out there, alone.. it was terrifying. I did my best to stay strong, I knew someone would help me. They did! I'm learning that people aren't scary or out to hurt me, but sometimes I'll growl and tell new folks that I need space. My current humans have people meet me with my most favorite of the balls. Once I see they have that, I know my humans trust them which means they must be legit. Also, if they're willing to play ball with me they pass the test to be my friend.

Being on a leash is something that also stresses me out. I've never had to be tethered before, I think I can be taught, but that's something we'll have to learn together.. is that okay? Because if you're with me through this, I think we can do anything together.

Hello! My name is Shadow and I am looking for my forever home. I have been in foster care for a few months because I have diabetes and we have been getting that regulated! We now know how much insulin I need twice daily to maintain my blood sugar so I am ready to find my happily ever after. My diabetes will require an extra special family but it's nothing too scary! If you haven't dealt with a diabetic pet before, my foster mom will make sure to give you lots of details and information! Every morning and every evening, at the same time, I will need my insulin which I am PERFECT for. No, seriously. I know I need it and will walk right up to you so you can give it to me. My foster mom has been so impressed! Also, I will need to be brought to the vet every 3-6 months to verify that my glucose levels are still maintaining. I require this extra care for my diabetes but other than that, I am a normal, happy guy! I love to play with the other dogs in my foster home and run around in the yard. I am perfect in my kennel and completely potty trained. After playing in the yard, I'm content just snuggling up on the couch and relaxing. I'm incredibly sweet and a good listener! My foster mom has a feeling that I may not be good with kitties but we don't know for sure so we can certainly verify if you are interested and have kitties in your home! My foster mom may be wrong. If you are looking for a sweet, happy go lucky guy that just needs some extra care, I'm your guy and I'm very worth it! I'm happy playing, sleeping next to you and getting love. I may require more but I am a very low maintenance boy otherwise!

Lucy's Interview

Tell me a bit about yourself? My name is Lucy and I am a fabulous Mature Bloodhound with the perfect dose of sass and silly antics.

Whats your favorite pass time? Where to start.. I love to spy on all my neighbors from the window. I also like to find a good chew bone, cozy spot on the couch and relax with my chew toy. I also enjoy walks and a dip in the kiddie pool my foster family got for me. I love to dunk my face in the water and take big drinks.

What would your ideal adoptive home be? My Adopters should have a home with a fenced in yard at least 5 ft plus. I like to run and chase small critters so it would keep me safe. It should be a home without kitties or other female dogs that are big.. I do great with small dogs and male dogs with proper slow introductions. My foster mom's Chihuahuas are my BFFs. I would also like a home all to myself as the only pup too. I do well with all humans and little humans as well. I would not do well in apartment or shared wall living.

What skills do you have? I am potty trained. Crate trained I even go in when asked. I know how to sit and even shake! I will sometimes throw up two paws! I also have a fabulous hound singing voice.
I am good with baths, nail trims, ear cleaning, and vet visits!

What skills could you work on more? I love to go for walks but need to walk in a more remote place as I get pretty worked up when I see other dogs out walking with their pup parents. I also love to steal rags and food off the counters! I think its super fun but my foster mom doesn't seem to think its as fun as I do.

What other things should we know about you? I am a super healthy gal but take medication daily to help me with urinary incontinence. That means I sometimes leak urine when hanging out or sleeping, but with my medicine I do not leak at all! Yay me! I am super a sweet girl and have been looking for my furever home for a long time now!

Whats your history? I joined my foster family back in Feb of 2017. I joined them after a local MN shelter I was staying at requested to transfer me from the shelter to a foster based rescue to help me find a home in an environment more suitable for myself. I was at that shelter because I was found running around as a stray.

Name: Zeena

DOB: 05/04/12 estimated
Weight: 35 lbs
Adoption Fee: PAID BY A GENEROUS DONOR

Zeena

is a gorgeous girl who is eager to please and has tons of love to give! She was found by her foster mom wandering the streets in pretty rough shape. Since she is so much happier and healthier now, she's so excited about life!

Zeena

is very playful and energetic and would make a good walking/jogging buddy, but needs to continue to work on leash training. She does well with SOME other dogs (she tends to be selective) and really loves to play with them when she finds a dog she can get along well with. A slow introduction will be needed and she tends to do better with male dogs. She has a prey drive so does not do well with smaller dogs and no cats or critters in the house for her. She would do the best with a fenced yard because she likes to chase squirrels and birds (hey who doesn't?) and should be supervised when outside as she has been know to scale a privacy fence to try to get a squirrel! Get out of my yard squirrel!

She loves to play and will always be up for a few rounds of tug-o-war. And when play time is over she likes to snuggle. She does great with the kids in her foster home (age 6 and 11) and loves to give kisses. I just remind them to be careful when playing with toys with her so that she doesn't get possessive of them.

Zeena

is crate trained, and knows a few basic commands (sit, recall-her name, wait and stay). Since she's so eager to make her humans happy, given time/patience and some dedicated training, I'm confident that she can learn more! This sweet girl developed some allergies and we have been feeding her Nutro (a limited ingredient diet) which seems to have helped. A 22lb. bag of Nutro is around $50 (should last about a month and a half). She also has some incontinence issues. She does go potty outside, but tends to have accidents inside as well. We've tried several medications for this and she has seen a specialist, but we can't quite pin point the problem. For now, she gets frequent outdoor potty breaks and wears a diaper indoors. Simple solutions diapers are about $11 per 12 pack of diapers (we use roughly a pack per 2-3 weeks, but this may vary depending on how long she's kenneled, how many potty breaks she gets, etc.)

Zeena is a great girl who has so much love to give. We know there is a family out there for her - we just have to find them! She looks bigger in her pictures but she is only about 35 pounds of sass, wiggle and unconditional love. She loves it at her foster mom's house but would love more than anything to find a forever home of her own!

Some of you may recognize Elvis from previous postings, but read on to learn a little more about what this soulful fellow has been dealing with recently. For those of you from other parts, Mississippi is the birthplace of American music, and Elvis Presley is one of her most favored sons. Presley had a hardscrabble upbringing in rural Mississippi - not so different from this fine dog - but he remained connected to his roots by his doting mother, Gladys. In the late 50s, as Presley began his meteoric rise to fame, Gladys fell ill and passed at the untimely age of 46. Here again, the parallels to our Elvis's story are heartbreakingly similar.



Elvis was rescued in 2009 - yes, nearly SIX years ago - along with a female dog that we believe was his mother. We named them Gladys and Elvis to signify their special bond; Gladys had tended to Elvis even after he'd lost sight in his left eye at a young age. The two were inseparable, and Elvis was distraught when complications from an infection took Gladys's leg. But even down one leg and one eye, this tough little family soldiered on, happy to have the company of one another and a roof over their head at ARF.



Knowing the strength of this bond, we were even more concerned than usual when we found a growth on Gladys's neck in late 2014. The growth was promptly removed, but years of hard living seemed to catch up to this sweet, 10-year-old girl. She had trouble healing in the months following the surgery, a fact that made more sense when we realized that the cancer had returned. Her good-natured demeanor remained, but it was clear that she was nearing the end of her road. Gladys enjoyed a beautiful final day in early February, laying in the warm Mississippi sun and leisurely watching the birds in a nearby park.



Much like his namesake, our sweet Elvis was devastated. We've made certain to give him lots of interaction with new friends in an effort to keep his spirits high, but we can't provide him with the one thing he truly needs: a family. He is a medium-sized dog that is full of cuddles and playfulness -- at roughly 7 years old, he definitely does not act his age smile emoticon Elvis is a sweet, friendly dog that needs a freshstart, and we know that the right forever home is out there. If you're looking to provide a new lease on life for one of our most deserving seniors, we'd be happy to provide more information about Elvis. And even if you're not ready to adopt, please consider coming to visit this handsome hound dog today -- he needs all the loving he can get.

Originally adopted out as a cute and happy puppy, Vinnie was (gratefully) returned to us after a concerned citizen stepped in; Vinnie's initial home was characterized as \""abusive\"" and he was subsequently handed off to two separate acquaintances that were unfortunately ill-equipped to provide the structure Vinnie needed to regain his trust in people. Thus, poor Vinnie arrived back to us fearful and with a broken spirit; humans had let him down. For close to a year, we worked with Vinnie to regain his trust and rebuild his confidence in people. And, after a number of smaller \""baby\"" steps, Vinnie was ready for some professional training and guidance. He made the journey to Golden Heart Canine in Montrose, Colorado, whereby he spent a full six weeks of intensive training to get back on track to being his best self! The transformation was amazing! Simply put, Vinnie was almost an entirely new dog from the moment we picked him up! Vinnie's former fear and mistrust had been replaced by love, comfort, and most importantly, faith in people. Vinnie has resided in the loving environment of a caring and supportive foster home since his return from Montrose, where he has continued to work on socialization and confidence building by visiting new places and meeting new people. Vinnie is now ready for a permanent family to callhis very own!

Vinnie loves to be the center of attention and doesn't at all mind acting \""goofy\"" to get you to smile! Vinnie can occasionally geta little insecure on walks with unfamiliar canine companions, but has made great strides in making introductions at adoption events, whereby he has been in the company of many unfamiliar dogs at one time. Because he still exhibits moments of insecurity, we would recommend structured introductions with new canine friends in a controlled environment. Vinnie will, In fact, sit at the door to actively greet new people and dogs as they walk in!

Vinnie is house-trained, crate trained, sleeps through the night and just a ton of fun during waking hours! Vinnie also loves his crate, which can also serve as a great place for 'down time' as needed.

Sweet eyes, a big heart, and in great shape...Vinnie will be your trusted friend for life, if simply given a chance...all Vinnie asks for is love and a firm but gentle hand to reinforce the skills he has recently acquired.

We thought we found one for herwe \""thought\"". This is until we got a phone call from a local Nashville, TN shelter informing us that she was dropped off by the family saying they couldn't keep her any longer. They never in the whole six years of owning her, took her to the vet. Now, they were discarding her and not even trying to find the rescue who originally pledged their faith and support to this young girl. She was at the shelter for 4 more days as we scrambled to find a foster home for her at one of the most challenging times..holiday weekend of Labor Day. One of our faithful and trusted foster moms went to the shelter to bring her home. In the shelter she was shaking and shivering with fear and confusion as to why she was in this noisy, chaotic environment called a shelter. She didn't belong there and shame on that horrible family who didn't even try to find an alternative for rehoming her or calling our rescue. She is not trash folks. She is a loving and beautiful soul that needs a better person or family the next time around. We will dedicate all we have to finding that right place AGAIN. She is housebroken, good with other dogs, seems OK with the resident cat at the foster home and is good with children. She is not leash trained and she is strong. She would benefit from a fenced yard as that is what she had in the former home. She is 55 pounds and around 6-7 years old. Most like 6 than 7. But who is counting? She has lots of love and lots of years to give to a new beginning. Please email us at ccrtennessee@gmail.com Please help Indie find her forever place in life.

Kiki is a sweet, funny, and loving female terrier. Since she loves to play, jump, skip and run, she'd be great in the dog agility training. She's approximately 3 years old, 18 pounds, fully vetted and microchipped. She loves going on walks and loves everyone - adults, kids, other dogs (hasn't been around cats but probably would be fine due to her sweet personality). She loves to roll in the grass and skips as she goes on walks. She'll make a wonderful addition to a family, couple or single individual. She was saved from a Texas animal control facility by 501(c)3 Russell Rescue Tennessee and is enjoying her foster home in Nashville. But she is looking forward to being adopted into a loving forever home. For more info and to schedule a time to meet Kiki in Nashville, please email melissarescuesdogs@gmail.com.

2-3 year old Male beagle about 15lbs. Was found in a southern Virginia shelter by a volunteer. 

This dog tested positive for Ehrlichia before arriving to the rescue. Ehrlichia is a very common type of bacteria that infects dogs and other species and is spread by ticks. Ehrlichia is not contagious to humans or other pets. The only way to get this disease is to be bitten by a tick that carries it. The treatment is typically 21-30 days of antibiotics. This dog started treatment upon arriving to the rescue.

To adopt this dog, or any OPH dog, fill out the simple online application at https://ophrescue.org 
Operation Paws for Homes, Inc. (OPH) rescues dogs of all breeds and ages from high-kill shelters in NC, VA, MD, and SC, reducing the numbers being euthanized. With limited resources, the shelters are forced to put down 50-90% of the animals that come in the front door. OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home."

Fergie is an absolute doll who wants nothing more than to love on her person and play with her dog friends. Shy at first, she quickly warms up and will lean in and ask for pets and give you kisses in return. She has been an excellent playmate with her foster brothers and sisters, takes the cue when they don't want her company, and will happily play with someone else or choose to go chew on a toy. She has been excellent in the house, no accidents, as well as in her crate. Fergie loves to run in the backyard, so a structural fenced in yard is required. She walks well on leash, but needs some time to get used to new surroundings. Once she is familiar, she is a great walking or hiking buddy. She has been introduced to cats and seems to do well with them. As you can see from her smile, she is a happy girl ready to be with that special someone or family to give them all of her love. Fergie's adoption fee includes current vaccines, microchip, and spay. To apply to adopt this very special girl, email adopt@carolinapaws.com. 

Adoption fee includes current vaccines, microchip and spay/neuter.  Adoption events are held on Saturdays from (11-2) inside the Blakeney Petsmart (9911 Rea Road Charlotte, NC) in the small animal section.* * * Please note: This a meet and greet only event.  Not all our animals may be at an adoption event. We do not accept applications at our adoption events.  Please review our adoption requirements on our website https://www.carolinapaws.com/adopt/adoption-process/ If interested in one of our rescued cats/dogs complete the online application.  Submitting an application does not obligate you to adopt nor guarantee an adoption.  It is in everyone's best interest to ensure the best possible match, and your cooperation is appreciated.

Her prior owner had a life changing event and it was determined that the best life for Skye is with an active family that wants a partner to share their life with her.

Skye is a velvet hippo, approx. 50lbs, and 1 1/2 years old.  She loves car rides, would love to have a running or hiking partner, and gets along very well with all types of canines.  She is confident but submissive.  She loves her nylabones, antlers and rope toys and will need a fenced yard and a consistent schedule.  She does not need to be crated because at her current foster home, she has 8+ other fur siblings to play with, from a tiny chihuahua to an 80lb dog.  Skye truly loves all canine friends!

She loves the dog park and she likes to sleep in the bed with her human.  She is one of the happiest velvet hippos her foster has ever met.  She needs at minimum a 30 minute walk twice a day.  She is crate trained but it isn't her favorite place.  

She is a beautiful soul!"

Aroon like any good red-blooded hound is a connoisseur of food and will SNIFF out only the best treats. Aroon is between 60lbs. He is a Redbone Coonhound mix that is about 5-6 years old. He spends his day inside asleep on the softest bed; outside he let's his nose show him the way! He absolutely loves playing with toys including killing the squeakers. He also loves playing in the toy box and pulling out all the toys. Aroon is dog friendly but would be happy being the center of attention in his family. 

Aroon is house and crate trained.

Willow is a beautiful girl, who is a bit of a diva. She is particular about her choice of canine friends, and can be a little particular about her people friends as well. She will require several introductions before she gets to know you, and can be a bit \""standoffish\"" at first. However, we have no doubt that once Willow finds her people, she will be a great companion! Willow came to us from a NC county shelter, and for that reason, she needs a little help building trust with her people friends. Hotdogs are her favorite, and have helped her gain trust with volunteers. Willow can also be possessive of her things, so we do not recommend her in a home with small children or other pets."

She is around 6 months of age and is expected to be somewhere between 30-40 lbs when full grown.
As a result of being a double merle Lady Bunny is completely deaf, blind in the left eye but does have some vision on the right.
It's very important to remember that she was born this way so she doesn't realize she's any different and it certainly doesn't slow her down at all.
She is a rather strong willed girl, very smart and high energy!
She is very treat motivated which has made training a lot easier!
So far she is doing fantastic with the hand signals for sit, down, stand, come, stay and spin.
She walks well on leash too.
She is fully crate trained and is doing great with house training.
Lady Bunny would do best with someone that is willing/able to continue her training. 
Aussies are a very smart breed and love to learn.
Lacking some vision from one eye and hearing doesn't change that.
Training is also a great bonding tool!
She absolutely loves playing with other dog's and would do great with another doggie companion.
It would be best for any potential doggie friends to have a more playful/high energy personality because we feel Lady Bunny would be rather overwhelming for an older more laid back dog.
She loves her people and is very attentive, meaning she checks in frequently without being reminded.
She stays too busy to be a cuddler though.
We are recommending she go to a home without small children due to the fact that when she gets overly excited, she can bite down a little too hard.
Not aggressively at all but it does pinch.
Being an energetic young puppy at times she still finds it difficult to keep all 4 paws on the floor when greeting people.
Lady Bunny isn't a fan of sharing her food or high value treats with doggie friends.
We have been working on this and she has made great progress so it very manageable.
Foster mom can fill you in on what we have been doing to work on the issue.
Lady Bunny is spayed, up to date on all vaccinations, current on heart worm/flea tick prevention and she is also microchipped.
We are requiring a meet and greet prior to adoption.
This is just to help ensure we get the best match possible for Lady Bunny as well as the potential adopter.
With her high energy level and love for playing with other dog's, we feel any existing dog's will need to meet her as well to make sure they don't feel overwhelmed by her high energy playful self.

Even though his previous owners threw him out of a car window, he has improved by leaps & bounds! He loves people, toys, and everything about his new life.

Baxter is thriving in his foster home and is the perfect little companion. He is very loyal to his people and super affectionate. He loves to sit in your lap and adores belly rubs. He has fun playing fetch with his favorite toy and going on daily walks. Baxter would do well as an only pet or with a friend â he loves everyone!  He is housebroken.

Unfortunately, Baxter was heartworm positive, but he started his treatment and is on his way to a healthy new life. Baxter will be available for adoption after completing his heartworm treatment (early Oct). We are currently taking applications so he can go straight to his new home when ready. Baxter is a foster-to-adopt candidate if you are located in the Greensboro, NC area.

If you are interested in adopting this dog, contact h2hadoptions@gmail.com. An all adult home with a fenced yard (fence must be attached to the home) is required to adopt from Hart-2-Heart Rescue.

There is an application process and adoption fee. We are an all-volunteer organization, and in addition to saving dogs, we have other responsibilities, so we appreciate your patience and understanding during this process. Response time can take up to 5 business days.

Please inquire only if you are willing to come to Greensboro, North Carolina to meet the dog after we schedule your home visit. We do not ship dogs or put them on transports. Adoption fee is $350.

Veterinary Care: All Hart-2-Heart Rescue foster dogs are spayed/neutered, current on heartworm prevention, parvo/distemper, bordetella, and rabies vaccines and are professionally groomed. As needed, our foster dogs have teeth cleanings, extractions, bloodwork and other diagnostic testing."

**Loves to sleep on the bed, but also doesnt mind his crate 
**Already knows that the outdoors is for pees and poops
**Likes taking walks but still not sure about the neighborhood dogs. Once he is neutered he will let you know. He is scheduled for Neuter this Thursday.

ROXIE is a BEAUTIFUL and SWEET Brindle and White American Pitbull Terrier/Labrador Retriever Mix.  She is approximately four (4) years old and weighs 70 lbs.  ROXIE is spayed and is up to date on all vaccinations including rabies. She is currently on HW prevention.   She is house trained.   ROXIE loves people. Adults and older children will be great for her.   

She is very smart and knows some commands such as: sit, lie down, and taking food gently. With additional training, she could learn much, much more! 

ROXIE loves other dogs and adores people. In fact, she would love to spend all her time hanging out with her people and have a dog sibling to hang out with.   She chases cats, so a home without kitties would be best. The fastest way to her heart is through a belly rub.   

ROXIE is still young and gets anxious when left all alone, so she would need to be crated when you leave home.  ROXIE will need positive crate training.  She has met with a great trainer (Total Pet Care LLC.) and everyone thinks that with someone who can give her the training, time and patience that she needs, ROXIE will be able to overcome her separation anxiety!  She will win over any pet sitter or dog walker that may help throughout the day. Total Pet Care LLC will also donate an e-session for foster/adopter transition counseling.  She is a loyal, loving and affectionate girl just waiting to find her forever home. Is it you?'

Chloe is a very sweet and loving dog. She loves to go for rides and rides very well. She loves to go for walks and walks well on a leash. Chloe loves her toys and is very playful. We do take her outside without her leash. She stays in the yard as long as you stay with her. She doesn't like other animals. She stays inside our home all of the time. She does well when left for a period of time. She does like to get on the couch, but only when we leave the house. I put a sheet over part of the couch and that's the only place that she lays. She has not had an accident in our house since she's been here. We've had Chloe in our home since October. My husband rescued her from New Bern. Her family was displaced and couldn't take proper care of her. Her former owners expressed a desire for my husband to bring her home and take good care of her. He brought her back and we had her checked out at our vet the next morning. Chloe tested positive for heartworms. She has completed treatment and is now heartworm negative. She gets Heart Guard monthly, as well as NexGuard. She is current on all vaccines. She has not been spayed. We couldn't have that done while she was being treated for heartworms. Chloe loves to be petted on and brushed. She is an awesome dog! We would keep her, but she doesn't get along with our boxers. She would be a great fit for someone only wanting one pet.

He enjoys car rides, especially if it means a trip to the pet store for some treats or a toy.  Patch craves attention and loves walking around the neighborhood looking for kids to give him belly rubs.  He told us children give the BEST belly rubs because their small hands make him ticklish.  He would do great in a home with children over the age of 10.  Since he is bigger and energetic we feel older children would be better!

My name is Lt. Dan and I am a year old mixed breed dog. We think I might be an Australian Cattle Dog mix or something, but one thing is for sure: I'm 100% handsome! I'm even more handsome with three legs! Your eyes do not deceive you: I am tripawed and a lucky boy. I am awesome with other dogs but my foster mom says I'm not that great with cats because oh boy do I like to chase them. I'm pretty food motivated and will take all of the snacks you'll give me... but I need a new family to help me watch my figure because of my disability.

Truth be told, I did not have the best start in life. I was dumped on the side of a road where I searched for my family and had to fend for myself. While looking for my family I was hit by a car. I was scared and lonely and was hurt really bad. I was so scared of people and it took three big scary men to catch me. They brought me to a hospital where I met my foster mom. She gave me pain medication and advocated for me. This is where the amazing Mel said foster mom could bring me into the rescue and make me better. They amputated my leg and my foster mom slowly gained my trust as I healed. As you can imagine I am still very scared around new people and strangers. I need my new family to come meet me a few times before I can go home with them. It would also be great if my new family has worked with a fearful dog before. I am getting better with trusting my foster mom about strangers and ignoring them. I love playing with my foster brothers and sisters and can play all day. I have foster kitties in the house that I will chase if they run. I am going to go play with my foster siblings now and my foster mom will tell you more.

Lt. Dan is up to date on vaccines, heartworm negative, and on flea, tick and heartworm prevention monthly. He LOVES playing with other dogs and gets along with dogs of all sizes. He can live with dog savvy cats. Lt. Dan is fearful of new people and his adopter with be required to come to New Jersey a few times to meet him and spend some time with him before he can go to his new home. His adopters will also need to have experience with fearful dogs and will need to work with a positive reinforcement trainer. Once he learns to trust you, Lt. Dan will cuddle with you all day if you let him. He is a medium energy dog who just wants to be with his person. He will gladly occupy you on a long walk or cuddle on the couch all day with you. Because he had his leg amputated his adopters will need to be vigilant about his diet, weight and keep him exercised. Lt. Dan has had a rough beginning but with love and dedication he can overcome his past and be a loving member of a family. Could that be you?

SOHO is a 501c3 public charity focusing on rescuing herding dogs in crisis on the East Coast. Your pets will need to be up to date on vaccinations and heartworm preventative in order to be considered for adoption. Lt. Dan does have some additional adoption requirements: his foster mom would like a potential adopter to come and visit Lt. Dan a few times before taking him home in order to help him bond to his new family. Please note that Lt. Dan is located in HIGHLAND LAKES, NEW JERSEY."

This gentle giant is such a loverâhe just always wants to snuggle and be right next to you, he will nudge his nose on your leg to get attention. He is very unaware of his size and is always trying to climb into his foster momâs lap. If you are laying on the couch or bed Spot will be right next to you and will make sure he can get as close as he can, so he gets lots of love.

He is crate trained and stays in the crate while his foster family is at work. He also sleeps the night in his crate just like the other pups in the house. Just say the word kennel and he will rush into his crate for that snack. He is very food motivated and is super gentle in taking treats. He knows basic commands like sit and down. He works well with snaps or a clicker when it comes to listening.

He gets along great with other dogs and can play all day with his toys and is always willing to give up his toy to the pesky puppies in the house. He lets these little girls crawl all over him and loves to play and chase them all over the backyard. You can tell he has been around lots of puppies in his life because he is as calm as it gets when these girl nibble and lick him to death. It did take him a while to open up to the other male dog in the house, but now they are buddies and you can see them lounging together on the bed or couch as well as running around to catch the puppies in the backyard. He is learning the leash but does get distracted easily and sometimes likes to pull when he sees something. But with work this can be broken. He weighs almost 80 pounds and has bald spots that unfortunately have not started to re grow even with proper food and care. But this is common with Blue Dobies and Spot doesn't know he is bald :)"

Sandy is looking for someone she can enjoy her golden years with, someone who can just love her, cuddle her, and make her feel like a princess.

Sandy would do best in a home where there are no other dogs or a very submissive dog that is about her size. She would be an ideal match for a couple, maybe even an older couple who understand what it's like to be aging.Sandy is located in New Windsor, NY (not too far from Poughkeepsie). Why not visit her and see if there's a love match? If you have another dog, you will need to bring him/her along.

Sandy is spayed, up-to-date on all vaccinations, and is microchipped.

She is being fostered in NY state. 

What we know about Winnie:
*sweet
*loves to be with people
*prefers her space with other dogs
*housebroken
*sleeps through the night

What Winnie's foster mom has to say about Winnie:
Who's that girl with the golden waves? It's Winnie! Winnie is a beautiful terrier mix. She's about 7 years old, and she's already quite the traveler! Winnie came to BDRA from a shelter in New Mexico, and she charmed hearts all the way from New Mexico to New York!

Winnie loves her people with all that she has. Her perfect day is a day spent with her person, giving cuddles and kisses and getting belly rubs. She tries very hard to be a good girl.

Winnie wants to be with her people at all times. She'll follow you from room to room, and will lay happily at your feet or in your lap as you work or watch TV. Sometimes she follows me so closely she actually steps on my feet. She can also be timid and submissive, and if she thinks she's in your way, she will do her best to avoid you.

Winnie has late immature cataracts, but has functional vision at this time. As her vision declines, she may be a candidate for cataract surgery. She receives eye drops every 12 hours and is an angel! She also has Anisocoria, which means her pupils are two different sizes. This does not affect her now, but will need to be regularly monitored. She is housebroken and sleeps quietly through the night.

Winnie can be tolerant of the other dogs (all males) and cats (one male, one female) in her foster home and may even sleep next to one, but more often, she does not like when another dog or cat gets too close to her. She'll give a warning growl, and if the dog doesn't move away, she will lunge. It does not escalate further than that. Out of the four male dogs here, there is one dog she likes very much (a blind poodle mix).

Winnie is diabetic and came into rescue underweight. She has since gained several pounds and is even a bit overweight! As she was an untreated diabetic, her diabetes is still being regulated, and so she will remain on medical hold. 
Blind Dog Rescue Alliance has voted against the use of electric fencing effective immediately."

Vinny is NOT your typical easy  going sweet beagle.  I know the photo is misleading however he can be quite the charmer with MEN.  Vinny is a self-conscious type of dog and is very suspicious of human motives when approached.  We attribute this to unpleasant early life experiences.  Vinny will do well in a home with just one man or a couple with dog experience.  Although good a on leash we just don't trust his behavior if a child were to run up to him or a person wanting to prove all dogs love them bends over his head.  He'd be OK in a  fenced yard and walks taken where there is limited exposure to encountering others.  Nose to the ground in the country he's probably a great candidate as a hunting dog.  He's more of that type of beagle than a docile house pet.    His guesstimated age is about FIVE years of age and he was rescued from a Newark, NJ shelter. He weighs in the range of 25 pounds.   He enthusiastically runs to you when called,  sits politely for food, guarding a bone is another matter so no long lasting treats for Vinny.  He goes to his bed/crate when asked,  He opts to hide under a flannel blanket curled up so tight that you don't even know he's inside the blanket so of course he feels a little vulnerable when you wake him. He's a late sleeper and he grumbles when he doesn't want to get up but we all know someone like this! He's a very clean dog too that takes his business outdoors. Vinny likes car rides.   He's is OK with cats and great with other usually bigger dogs. Bottom line if you're a single male in a more suburban or country location, don't have kids; like to hike for long periods of time Vinny could really make a turn around  in his behavior.  I believe the key to his success is sufficient exercise to relieve his tension coupled with a protocol for rehabilitating his unwanted quirks.

When you walk through the kennels and some dogs are barking, trying to get your attention, Sheba is the one sitting quietly, politely looking up at you, hoping you'll ask to meet her.  Politeness is one of Sheba's finest qualities!  Sure, she's a little powerhouse on a leash, but she is perfectly behaved.  She sits when asked and takes treats gently.  She takes a quick zoom around our exercise yard, chases after a few toys, then comes right back to stand beside you and get lots of attention.  She adores people and if she was any sweeter she would be made of sugar.  Sheba doesn't have much experience with other dogs but she is open to meeting them and seeing how it goes.

Update: Sadie and Jada will soon be seeing a veterinary ophthalmologist for a complete exam.

Five year old Jada and her best buddy, six year old Sadie, are a truly bonded pair - and they're both blind.

Although Sadie, a neutered male, is blind he always knows where Jada is - and she relies on him. When they go for leash walks with their mom, Sadie is the leader and he walks ahead of his mom and Jada follows behind her - it's quite the parade.

Sadie was especially attached to his dad who died a few months ago. He was his loyal companion and stayed right with him throughout his illness. He was also with him when he died.

Jada and Sadie's owner now can't afford to care for them and she's anxious to get them both to a veterinary ophthalmologist for a thorough eye exam and treatment.

Our wonderful volunteer took them both to be groomed and vetted the week of August 7th.

The groomers adored both dogs. \""Jada is a real sweetheart\"" and Sadie was fine once he was lifted onto the grooming table (because he is blind he was a bit panicked by being lifted by strangers but he settled down quickly.) Now both dogs are clean and beautiful!

Our vet diagnosed Jada with juvenile cataracts and we hope they're operable and she can regain some sight. Sadie has cataracts and glaucoma, he's now on two eye medications to help reduce the pressure in his eyes.

The immediate need is to find a loving, caring adult only home for these two special cockers. CSRNE will pay for all ophthalmological care and medications. Our vet said both dogs are otherwise in good health.

Both Jada And Sadie were purchased from a Manchester, NH pet store at 12 weeks of age. They started going blind when they were about 4 years old. Their condition, juvenile cataracts, is genetic so the purchased them from an irresponsible puppy  mill that is breeding cocker puppies with the gene  for juvenile cataracts. But quite frankly the puppy mill doesn't care - they've already gotten their money and now it's Jada and Sadie who will pay the real price for the irresponsible breeding practices of mercenary puppy mills and the pet stores who so carelessly purchase their puppies.

We can only help dogs like Jada and Sadie if you, our friends, become their advocates. Do you know a special person who might be willing to give these two dogs the care and attention they so deserve?

We know we're looking for a rare individual who has the time to care for Jada and Sadie but we're hoping their cocker angel is out there somewhere willing and able to help these two devoted cockers.

We ask everyone interested in adopting to please fill out and send in our adoption application and restraint agreement before we invite you to meet any dogs.   Once your application is approved, we can proceed!

If you are looking for a dog that brings a smile to your face and makes you laugh, Lulu is the dog for you. Lulu has a wonderful attitude about life, she is happy and contented no matter what the situation. 

Lulu knows her basic commands: sit, stay, down, heel, off, look at me and crate. 
Lulu graduated from 2 positive training classes with Wonder Dogs in West Berlin, NJ All the trainers just loved her and she learned so fast. 

She would do best in a home with older children as she jumps when excited.
Lulu is a smart pup and a quick learner. She is even great with agility.  She also has learned how to walk on a tredmill for exercise.

When she is not enjoying a walk or some play time, Lulu wants to snuggle up close to you on the couch and give kisses. She's a real love bug.
While she enjoys an active lifestyle, she is crate trained and is not stressed out by spending time in the crate. Lulu is very housebroken.

Because she hasn't lived with another dog before we feel she would benefit from being the only dog. She can have neighborhood dog friends to Walk with and play dates at home with dogs once she gets to know them well, and if their play style is similar to hers. Lulu enjoys being the center of attention with the people who love her. 

Lulu is in need of a Foster Home, or an Adopter. She is living in one of our partner boarding kennels, since her family returned her because they were having a baby. 
She is taken care of by the staff and our volunteers everyday, but she misses being in a home with someone to cuddle with and a fenced yard to play in. 
We offer to anyone interested in fostering or adopting to start out with weekend sleepovers or day trips, to spend time getting to know each other. 

The adoption fee for Lulu is waived because it is sponsored.

If you are interested in fostering or adopting Lulu please contact us at wjvolunteers@yahoo.com.

Mylo is a special 10 year old Schnauzer looking for someone who appreciates his loyal and fiercely protective personality.  He was adopted 2 years ago but sadly surrendered due to his ownerâs health issues.  He is loving and playful and doesnât look or act like a senior at all, and gets along with most dogs.  Like so many schnauzers he thinks his job is to protect his person and is looking for an adult home with just one or 2 people he can bond to and not many people coming and going, or where he can be put away when guests visit.  
Email njwoof@cs.com for an appointment to meet him.

We do not have a shelter- all our pets are in foster homes and can be seen by appointment only during the week, or at our weekly pet adoptions every Sunday at the Animal Clinic of Morris Plains from 12:30 to 3PM at 3009 Route 10 East, Morris Plains, NJ.  Please email njwoof@cs.com for the fastest response to make sure the dog you are interested in will be there.
To help us better match a pet to your household, we request you fill out an application on our homepage www.secondchance.petfinder.com and copy and paste it into an email, or print it and bring it to our adoption day when you come.   Local inquiries only please- we do not do long distance adoptions.
Can't adopt but still want to help this dog?  Click on the Sponsor Me button at the top of this page to donate toward his/her care!  All donations are tax-deductible and go directly toward the care of our rescue dogs.  Thank you for your support!"

Twix is just another of the many local needy seniors who have found their way to us recently- their care is expensive but worth it to give them a chance when they need help the most.  Please share and help us support his care so we can continue to help others like him!

This ~10 year old mostly toothless tiny terrier mix was left behind when his elderly owners moved- literally?
They left him in the street instead of bringing him to a shelter.  Luckily a neighbor took them in and reached out to rescues.  Poor Steve hadnât seen a vet in many years and in addition to his rotting teeth, had a very large infected tumor on his hind end (common in older males who were never neutered). We will spare you the gruesome pics but heâs had surgery to remove it and happily it was benign and he is ready to start his new life!  Steve is only about 10lbs, very cheerful and spunky for an older guy and good with other dogs.  Email njwoof@cs.com to adopt Steve!

These pictures may not look like a big deal, but since he came to us terrified and not letting us touch him when we first pulled him from the pound, these pics show a huge transformation!  Young Ralphie has transformed into a happy playful cuddly guy with his foster mom.  Dogs like him are the most rewarding to foster or adopt- while it is harder to find someone to look past the initial fear, earning their love and trust makes it so much more special.  
It probably wonât be love at first sight and he wonât jump up and give you kisses when you first meet him (or greet your visitors happily), but the love and loyalty he shows his chosen people is worth the extra effort.  He does seem to have a possessive streak over furniture and his chosen people and might be better in a home with just one person and someone who understands when to respect his space.  Ralphie is about 2 years old, maybe younger, neutered, updated on shots and about 15lbs full grown.

Heâs here with us at Second Chance now!

This special pup and his adorable whiskers have been through a lot in his first 11 months of life, and he is still learning to trust people.  He was originally a very shy pup rescued from a hoarding case.  He is very timid and fearful at first, especially with men, but is more comfortable around other dogs especially smaller ones and follows their lead.  
We are not quite sure of his mix but his terrier whiskers, curled tail and white speckled feet suggest many breeds mixed together!  Waldo is 28lbs full grown and 11 months old, neutered and updated on shots. Waldo is looking for a calmer adult home with at least one other doggie friend to help show him the world isnât such a scary place.  Email njwoof@cs.com to meet him

This feisty but cute little guy was saved from death row a couple of times...the rescue who originally âsavedâ him was going to return him to the shelter to be euthanized when he showed barrier aggression upon arrival, but a rescue friend reached out to us as a last ditch effort to save him.  He was very defensive at first but once he bonds heâs a cuddly playful sweetheart!  The caring kennel staff at our vet Animal Clinic of Morris Plains spent a lot of extra time during his stay there getting him to trust them so his true personality could shine through his initial fears.  Ollie is about 5-6 years old and gets along with most other dogs, weighs 12lbs and we think he may be a min pin/Yorkie or Schnauzer mix?  Oh, and he has the cutest little natural Mohawk!  Heâs looking for an adult home with someone who will respect his space and possessions especially at first and give him time to bond- you will be rewarded with an adorable loyal best friend who will make you laugh every day with his antics and will literally jump into your arms for attention!  Heâs not a fan of vets and groomers- heâs the type who has to get to know you before being handled like that.  Email njwoof@cs.com to meet this special survivor!

Since they have nowhere to go, we are hoping someone will be able to give one of them or even both of them a place to go.

Shaggy & Sunny are 10-year-old Shih Tzus who are fixed, up to date with vaccines and are good with people young and old. They are friendly with other dogs but when they see cats, they bark at them so maybe a cat free home would be best. In spite of their age, they are in good health & not on any medications. They enjoy playing and eating - who doesn't? Dad has been feeding them Alpo and Pedigree dog foods.

Shaggy & Sunny would love to go to a new home together, but the most important thing is that they have a safe place to go so if that means two separate homes, then that is what their dad will have to do.

Shaggy & Sunny are NOT with Eleventh Hour Rescue but we are helping their dad to network them for new homes. If you are interested in meeting either or both of the dogs, please contact Armando at gomez782@aol.com or 901-210-0175 - they are currently located in Wharton, NJ."

All these pups are crate trained and walk wonderfully on the leash. They do well with other dogs and cats. They would each make perfect family companions too!

Our fosters begin basic training, housebreaking, and leash walking skills to help pair you with the perfect pup for life! 

We update Petfinder and our website multiple times daily, so if a dog is available on Petfinder and our website they are still available for adoption. We process all our applications in the order we receive them, and for that reason sometimes the dog or dogs in whom you are interested in may be adopted before your own processing concludes.

She's friendly to people, but like most terriers, she can be scrappy with other female dogs of her size. She would get along fine with a larger dog or a male dog. 
Nora is spayed and vaccinated. She is missing 2 toes on her left rear leg as a result of getting a string wrapped around it when she was young. They required amputation. But, she's adjusted well and gets around fine. With a typical haircut, the hair covers the feet so this isn't obvious and doesn't affect her appearance.
She is accustomed to being able to get out into a fenced yard at will via a doggy door. Her adopter will need to be willing to work with her housebreaking skills if you don't have one in your home environment. Having a fenced area and time and patience to help her make this adjustment will be helpful during this process. She lives on one level so would also need to be trained to do steps if needed.

This is a referral listing to help her get a good home. She is located out of state ( she is not located in NJ) and any interested applicants would need to be willing to travel for adoption. Her adoption fee is $350 to cover her spay and vaccine costs. NO AKC papers are given with adoptions.

She was raised with many dogs around, but as sheâs matured her desire to have other dogs around has diminished. We are trying to find Abbey a home where she will get undivided attention and have her humans to herself.  She is a bit aloof when meeting new people but as long as people let her get to know them on her terms she settles in nicely. Sheâs extremely loving with her people, enjoys snuggling and gives gentle kisses often, but doesnât do well with active or small children. She walks extremely well on a leash, and while she gets slightly reactive when she sees other dogs during walks, she can easily be re-directed with treats and praise. Abbey is an independent player, and if given a rope-toy or a bone sheâll play all by herself for quite some timeâ¦ for some reason she plays best with these items if a person she enjoys is watching her. She loves to run, and is extremely fast, so a fenced-in yard is necessary. Being a greyhound mix, she shouldnât be with any small animals (namely cats, rodents, etc.). Sheâs very vocal, and makes strange howling sounds, but when sheâs relaxed she doesnât make a peep. She does love her crate, and will settle into it nicely.

Hi, I'm Mignon, so named because I'm known to be such a TENDER little DELICACY with my ânuttyâ facial expressions, sweet personality, flamboyant style and AMAZING character ! I'm a 2 year old male Schnorkie (Yep, it's a real breed now folks! Google: Schnauzer / Yorkie blend ~ who knew !?!) who's really a DARLING, super SMART, inquisitive,GENTLE, funny LITTLE bundle of PURE JOY ! I am ever so slightly shy at first from all the many rapid changes in my short life but warm up to everyone instantly if you simply give me two seconds and then I learn new things immediately cause I'm super, SUPER SMART and VERY WILLING to please! Once I'm comfortable, I literally prance everywhere I go, out to politely strut my stuff for all my many admirers who say I'm sooooooo cute! To top that, I'm working diligently on my housebreaking skills, already crate trained and even sits and/or PAWS for treats and attention ! My rescue friends promise I'll easily get the perfect home everyone agrees that I TRULY deserve ~ bless their hearts for lovin me so much. At only 18 pounds and 12 inches tall (at the withers), some folks would consider me TINY but my heart is as BIG as ALL outdoors and I'm EASY to take anywhere YOU'D like to go ~ I promise to shower YOU with love and a life time of devotion !

Italian Greyhound / Terrier mix
Born 10/2014

Contact Kate at kmolsbe@gmail.com for more information about Star.

Starlight...Starbright - here is beautiful Star!!  Born approx. October 2014 and weighing 25 pounds, Star was recently returned to NMAF after 2.5 years when her family moved to Wisconsin and Star could not adapt to the change.  Rather than have her rehomed so far away, she flew back to ABQ and is safely back in foster care and doing well.  She has changed very little in her time gone from NM and is still the same sleek size and weight she was 2.5 years ago (wouldn't we all like that!!).  We think she is an Italian Greyhound mix because of her long legs and slender, graceful body, and she still loves to do her \""Ballerina Twirl\"" at feeding time (see her video).  She has a shiny black coat that sheds very little, pretty white socks and a star shaped mark on her neck.  She loves soft touches under her chin, gives LOTS of kisses, and special stuffed toys - especially the stuffing!  Unfortunately, she doesn't like kitties but enjoys the company of other friendly dogs, though is not much of a \""player\"" and could easily be happy as an only dog - preferably with someone that is retired or works from home.

Star came back to NMAF with some anxiety and reactivity issues which, with calming medication and retraining that includes impulse control with our trainer, Natalie Cabral, she has turned a corner and is ready for a new life!  NMAF will train her adopter with the skills required to work with her and keep her well balanced and happy.  She should not live with children as they bring on anxiety - this may be due to too much rough handling in her previous family where their were very small children present.  She would be a great dog for a single female or male in a quiet environment or a retired couple.  She is spayed, up-to-date on all shots, heartworm tested & on preventative, and microchipped.  She also uses a doggie door and is house-trained.  She does not attend our Adoption Clinic at PetSmart but can be met at her foster home most evenings.  This little girl is really special, sweet, and loving once she trusts you, and can be a wonderful companion for the right owner.

Because home visits are required, NMAF dogs cannot be adopted out of the greater Albuquerque / Santa Fe area.

Star does not attend our Adoption Clinic at PetSmart but can be met at her foster home most evenings.  Please contact the person listed above to meet Star.

Brandenton,FL (Manatee County).
Sophia was saved from a North Florida shelter. She was found abandoned with her two full grown puppies at an empty house. When we got her she was very lethargic, her gums were pale, and she could barely stand. We got her into the vet and after getting bloodwork done, she was diagnosed with AIHA, Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. Evidently, this condition is prevalent in Spaniel dogs. The treatment is a medication called prednisone and she has responded well to it. We are continuing her weekly frequent blood counts until she is stable, then we will progressively decrease the prednisone. She has since perked up, and is able to get around without issues. She is the sweetest dog who wags her tail all the time. She loves to talk to you, which apparently is a trait of the Clumber Spaniel! She has not been crated but does go in one without issue. She is potty trained, uses a dog door, and gets along great with all the dogs in her current foster home. She loves to get belly rubs and has a big appetite due to the prednisone. Sophia still needs to gain some weight but she's slowly making progress on that end, she weighs about 35-40lbs but should weigh around 50lbs. Her blood count is coming up and although it plateaued last week we are hoping for an increase in the next few days. We are hopeful Miss Sophia will recoup from this. AIHA will always be present but with the appropriate medication dogs with this condition can live a healthy long life span. We are looking for a foster for this sweet girl who will continue to be able to care for her, get her blood work done, and would not be afraid of a challenge. Sweetest dog ever, she will be a project dog. Please contact us if interested in being a medical foster. All medicals are paid by us, and we will oversee her medical treatment plan. Sophia deserves a chance to live. Please look her up!!
We are a foster-based rescue organization with foster homes throughout the state of Florida. We predominantly save dogs from municipal shelters throughout the Southeastern U.S. Our rescue dogs live in foster homes - there is no central facility. If interested in meeting one of our wonderful adoptable dogs, please fill out an application at ewenityfarmsbch.com.

Becky has not had an easy life and we want her to be the only animal in the house so she doesnât has competition for affection as she can be very dog selective.  Becky can be described as a bit of a couch potato.  Give her a couch and some fleece blankets and she is a happy girl!!!

When he is happy to see you he actually smiles. Jake loves having his belly rubbed and loves to cuddle. He loves to sleep in your room close by and keep you safe.

Jake has been with his family since he was a puppy. He loves to go on walks and hang out in the backyard which needs to be fenced in. He is fully housebroken and has never ruined anything in the house. Jake is very friendly and loves people. He has no medical conditions and is not on any sort of special diet.

Jake needs a good home with no other animals. He is a great companion and friend and this is what he is looking for. Unfortunately Jake got into a scuffle with a neighbors dog and now animal control will only allow him to find a new home outside of Bergen County. We are heartbroken at having to surrender him, but we have no choice in this matter.

Jake is NOT with Eleventh Hour Rescue but we are helping his family to network him for a new home. If you would like to meet him, please contact Janet directly by email at elohrmann@dumontnj.org as soon as possible as his situation is urgent. He is located in Northern NJ."

We were not able to actually take possession of Pixie until our great vet in SI did their due diligence. The Vet staff took great care of her while she had her stay and we are grateful for their assistance in keeping her safe. She otherwise would have most likely wound up in a kill shelter. 
Pixie has already gained 6 lbs but still needs some more healthy weight gain. 
This petite sweetie pie is super lovable, seems unphased by other dogs and just wants to snuggle and give kisses. 
Please consider applying to adopt or foster her by filling out the application at www.nybullycrew.org Thank you!"

Sandy is a senior so she does go out to the bathroom often. She loves to be outside in the yard and soak up the sun, she enjoys her walks too. Sandy is looking for someone she can enjoy her golden years with, someone who can just love her, cuddle her, and make her feel like a princess.

Sandy would do best in a home where there are no other dogs or a very submissive dog that is about her size. She would be an ideal match for a couple, maybe even an older couple who understand what it's like to be aging.Sandy is located in New Windsor, NY (not too far from Poughkeepsie). Why not visit her and see if there's a love match? If you have another dog, you will need to bring him/her along.

Sandy is spayed, up-to-date on all vaccinations, and is microchipped. 

Please note: While some of our dogs have lived in a home environment, we cannot guarantee that they are housetrained.

Please read the following comments below before applying to adopt one of our dogs. 
 
We do require that anyone wanting to adopt one of your dogs will have to come to Ohio.  We do not transport or fly dogs to any location.  We want to meet the new family and see the interaction between the dog and human(s). If you have a dog it is required that the dog(s) come with the family so we can see the interaction between the dogs.  
 
You will have to fill out an application to adopt one of our dogs. We require a Vet reference and home visit, that is mandatory.  
 
We will not adopt out to owners that have an invisible fence or doggie doors. It does not protect the dog from humans or other animals from harming the dog. 
 
If you do not practice proper care of your past or current dogs you will be denied.  We feel that the dog needs an annual wellness exam with the Vet. It is a state law all dogs must have a rabies shot.

She is not a typical 1.5 yr old dog, she is learning to be a dog. So she needs a yard to run, not tied up or forced to learn a leash right now. She is working on walking and running on three legs.

No apartment life for her, or being left alone at home for 8 plus hours.

Iâm a boxer/pittie mix with a brindle pattern and I barely shed at all. I'm just over 1 year old and weigh about 60 lbs.  I have always looked at the bright side of life, even when I was just 10 months old, pregnant and homeless. I was still a very happy pup. I was blessed to be taken in by SOS where I was safely able to give birth to 8 beautiful and healthy puppies.  Now that theyâve all been adopted, I am hoping to find a wonderful forever home of my own.  I am great with kids (Iâve got natural mama instincts) but because of my size I'd do best with older, bigger kids. I'm young and still have a lot of puppy enthusiasm so I play too rough for little ones. I think other dogs are amazing to play with and  I'm a champion at Tug-O-War and fetch.  Iâll even bring my toys to share so that we can all have fun.  I am always up for a good snuggle.  Belly rubs and back scratches are appreciated as well.  I think cats are curious creatures. I love to chase and sniff them, but they never seem to understand I just want to play! Iâll leave them alone if you tell me to though.  I absolutely love, love, love to run (zoomies are the best!), but I could still use some work on leash training.  Iâve got places to go and trees to sniff!  But do you want to know whatâs even better than running?  Eating!  I havenât met a snack I didnât like... fruits, veggies, you name it!  And Iâll tell you a secret... Iâm willing to learn pretty much any trick in the book if youâre willing to share your burger with me!  I can be a bit skittish around loud noises like fireworks, thunder, big trucks, etc--- they can kind of freak me out.  But, during the last storm, my foster mom gave me a treat every time there was thunder and it didnât bother me so much after that.  Basically, if it involves food, Iâm up for anything!  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention I am completely house-trained as well.  I know I could be a perfect dog for your family; I bring a bit of extra sunshine wherever I go and Iâll love you unconditionally if you just give me the chance.  What do you say?  Is there room in your life for me?

He is a sweet, young boy that is full of energy. He loves going to the park, running, hiking and being outside. Sammie would spend all day playing fetch if he could. His favorite toys are volleyballs and soccer balls. Sammie has done well meeting and playing with other dogs and cats. He is crate trained and housebroken. Sammie is a smart boy and has done well learning simple commands and training. He will benefit from having a new owner that will continue to work with him and keep him active. After a walk, Sammie loves snuggling up on your lap, laying in the sun, or crawling under the covers for a nap. He is about a year old and the perfect size weighing between 35-40 lbs. With his energy level, he  can get rough when he plays and would not be a good match for young children. Sammie is a lovable boy and would be a great addition to an active family!

She has a significant medical journey ahead of her. 

Pebbles came into our care from a rural Ohio shelter positive for Lyme, Ehrlichia, and Heartworm. She has been treated for Lyme and Ehrlichia and is in process of heartworm treatment.
She had her first immiticide injection already and will have the next 2 injection series in about 2&1/2 weeks. She has a slightly enlarged heart that was assessed by Medvet cardiology and requires no medication(just annual echos to monitor).

She also needs a dental, a small mass on her lower right eyelid removed, and an FHO for a right hip injury once she is confirmed heartworm negative so she can enjoy her golden years pain-free.

All of Pebbles previously mentioned veterinary requirements will be covered by Stop The Suffering over the course of her healing journey until she is medically cleared for official adoption.

Pebbles is an absolute sweetheart and loves people and LOVES the outdoors and walks.
She does get along with other dogs, but requires proper introductions and would not be a fit for a home with active and playful dogs. Other dogs would need to be laid back or senior companions. She has been good with kids, hasn't met cats.

Considering all she's been through and will be going through over the next several months, a quiet, stable home where she can rest, recuperate, and relax is ideal.


Her adoption fee is $195

Pebbles will require strict physical activity restriction while she continues heartworm treatment to prevent a pulmonary embolism; minimal exertion and on leash only activity in yard.

Are you the perfect foster-to-adopt family Pebbles is searching for? If so, you can apply for her now at www.stopthesuffering.org

Her adoption fee is $195 and includes spay/neuter, microchip, fecal/deworming, negative heartworm, vaccines and prevention up to date. Ohio residents only.

STS is a foster based, volunteer run, rescue. As such, we do not have a physical location or hours for you meet any foster dog and it does take time to answer each inquiry. All dogs are in homes and once an application is approved and a home visit is complete you are able to schedule meet and greets with available dogs.We encourage interested individuals to get approved prior to searching as it helps expedite the process. A petfinder inquiry is not a substitute for an application. For detailed information about our adoption process including fees please visit our website athttp://www.stopthesuffering.org."

Rescued last year as what we thought was a hospice from an Ohio shelter; she was completely covered with mammary tumors from a life as a breeder dog. 
Our wonderful rescue vet did several surgeries and all tumors were removed; she also had a tummy tuck, was spayed, and is healthy, happy and patiently waiting now for her forever home.
She loves all humans....just the sweetest and most affectionate girl ever and will give you all the kisses you want. Great on car rides; great on a leash; crate and house trained and has never had an accident. Quiet and doesn't make a peep inside the home. Outdoors, she will bark and growl at neighbors dogs.
She is unpredictable around dogs so she is best suited, and we prefer, she go to an only pet home. She does ignore the lazy sleeping seniors she walks by to go on potty breaks, but does get a bit reactive around younger and the more active pups. Considering her life was a constant breed and motherhood cycle, it's probably why she reacts. 
She is the sweetest,  and most gentile couch potato and companion is that's what you're looking for. 
Ethel is located in Central Ohio. Potential adopters must be within a reasonable driving distance for initial meet and greets, and home checks.
To adopt; completed application,indoor home only, own your home, no other pets, vet and professional reference ; if approved, a meet and greet and home check will then be scheduled.

Merlin was an owner betrayal and as you can imagine, terrified after going from a home to the chaos of a shelter.
Although the shelter had him listed at 11-12 years old, he is estimated to be between 5-7...probably closer to 7. Because of his \""bite\"" risk-and he has not bit anyone since rescued, no young children in any potential home...teens and up should be fine.
Merlin needs to be handled carefully only when he's getting his teeth looked at. It's the only time he gets nervous. He does have some age appropriate tartar. This guy is very food and treat motivated. He has two small lipomas on each side of his chest. They were aspirated and are not abnormal and merely fatty tumors. He does not like outfits and will react if you try to put a coat or sweater on him. He LOVES attention and is a great lap pup. Doesn't show well at events as he is loyal to his people which is his breed trait.
He is fully vaccinated, HW negative and neutered. He is cute as the devil, behaves like a perfect gentleman, does well with small to large dogs, listens well, house broken, obedience trained and loves car rides.

He is rather new to our rescue and we will post more about him as we get to know him.
House Manners: Spruce kept a clean indoor run when we was in the kennel room.
Basic Training: Unknown, will evaluate soon
Other Dogs: Spruce has been in a kennel run and in play yards with similar sized dogs and has done well.
Cats: Unknown, will evaluate soon

Important PLEASE read if interested in adoption:
We have a pretty open adoption policy, apartments, unfenced yards, and young kids are okay, but only if the pet you are interested in is a good fit for that situation!!! Some dogs may require a fence of a certain type and height, due to safety, the breed or known history. We are looking for pet parents that provide vet care such as routine vaccines for their pets and heartworm prevention for dogs. Please understand we do cross check vet references and landowners/landlord policies and cannot process applications with incomplete or incorrect information.
We asked that you take your newly adopted dog for a vet exam in the first 30 days to establish with your vet and obtain their heartworm prevention prescriptions and have a fecal exam administered as some pets may need additional de-womers after leaving our care.
Please submit an Pre-Adoption Application by clicking our logo button below (if visible) or visiting www.petangelsrescue.org to show your interest in adoption (Only submit one app). This questionnaire simply helps inform us if the dog you are interested in might match your families dynamics based on what we have learned about that dog.

Secure VISIBLE fencing is required; invisible fencing WILL NOT contain this breed.
Oklahoma dogs are not available to adopters who live in an apartment.

Blu came to GPRO from an Oklahoma kill shelter suffering from Parvo and very emaciated. He spent his first week in the ICU, and is now fully recovered - he's healthy, enjoying his carefree puppyhood, and ready to find his fur-ever home! Blu is a Great Pyrenees/Husky and/or Great Dane mix. Beyond his strikingly gorgeous blue eyes and good looks Blu is confident, social, happy-go-lucky, and very smart. He is house trained, crate trained, a great leash walker, a good car rider, knows some basic obedience commands, and is well-mannered for his young age. He loves attention, looooves toys and playing fetch and tug-of-war, chasing the water from the water hose, hunting bugs in the yard, playing with dog buddies, and taking siestas stretched out on his back. This little social butterfly is looking for an active family that will provide him the continued, proper raising, enrichment and training he will need. He would be best in a home with older kids as he's an athletic yet super clumsy pup that is also mouthy. Blu would enjoy a home with a fun-loving dog friend or two.

Blu has received all three rounds of puppy vaccines, and is microchipped, dewormed, utd on prev meds, and neutered. Submit your adoption application at www.nationalpyr.org to adopt this love bug! Blu is fostered in the Tulsa area; all meet & greets at the foster home are scheduled once your application is processed. All GPRO adopted puppies under 6 mo old are required to be enrolled in a puppy level obedience class within 30 days of adoption. This is to insure this giant breed is successfully raised to be a good dog citizen, and is manageable and well-mannered when fully grown. We highly recommend all adopted dogs regardless of age attend an obedience class as it is a great way for adopters to bond with their new dog, continue building the dog's level of manners and skill set, have a local, professional resource, and also offer enrichment and socialization for the dog."

LotsaDots was rescued from a shelter in Oklahoma. She had several very large mammary tumors, which have been removed. Dots is 5 to 6 years old, and weighs about 16 pounds - all solid muscle. She isn't really crazy about being outside - except to potty; she would rather hang out with her people in the house, and maybe have a snack or two (or three). Dots is good with other dogs and with cats. We have not seen her around children, but as much as she loves attention we think she would be fine with older kids (7 & up), and maybe even little ones. Dots rides well in the car, and usually walks well on a leash - though she does pull a bit when she sees something interesting. She would be happy as an only dog, or with another canine companion. Dots is crate trained (tho she doesn't really care to be crated), and she appears to be house broken.   

Our minimum suggested adoption fees for 2018 are: Adult Dogs $175, Puppies under 12 months of age $200, and American Hairless Terriers $225.

Mickey was a stray in Tulsa, running scared with an injured leg. We were finally able to catch him and he warmed up immediately. His leg was broken, but we had surgery done to repair things and he's doing great. Mickey can run and jump with the best of them. Once his recovery is 100%, you'll never know he had a problem.

Meet \""Wrangler\"" and \""Levi,\"" the Denim Brothers! They are rescue dogs No. 275 & 276 that have come to us here at The HouseTop Ranch. Word is that they were born around June 10 and come from a ranch out by Burns, Oregon. The mix is supposed to be border collie, kelpie & heeler. One thing's fer sureâthey are all stock dog!

These cuties are currently enjoyin' themselves camping up in the Ochoco Mountains where they are learning about the great, big world out there. They are happily munchin' on horse an' cow turds, grasshoppers, sticks, and alfalfa pellets while explorin' further and further from camp everyday. Not much scares these lil' scampsâ not even big ol' angus cows and calves that wander by.

These boys have had their first shots, have been wormed and are chipped. They have been very-well socialized to two-leggeds and other dogs. Like all ranch-bred dogs they are smart, lively, and active. Stock dogs really do best when they have some sort of job to do EVERY DAYânot just weekends, even if its just horseback riding, supervising chores around the farm, agility sports, or real cow or sheep herding work. These pups will not do well in a small, urban yard where they get walked around the block once a day.

The adoption fee for each boy is $400 which includes a \""goody bag,\"" his medical records and a free wellness exam from one of our local vet partners. In addition, there is a REFUNDABLE alter deposit which is returned after proof of neutering before the age of nine months. For more information contact Herd U Needed A Home Canine Rescue at 541-647-4080 or hunahapps@gmail.com. Fill out our application form here: http://herduneededahome.com/hunah-dog-adoption-applicationâ¦/ ~ct

PLEASE PROVIDE A PHONE NUMBER WITH YOUR INQUIRY. Note: preference will be given to working/herding situations, ranches, farms, large acreages, horseback homes, and agility/trial homes.
No apartment or condo living

There is a 200.00 REFUNDABLE spay/neuter deposit 

All stock dogs need lots of mental and physical stimulation to be happy and to stay out of trouble. A short walk around the block is not going to be sufficient. Herding breeds do best when they have a ''job'' to do which occupies most of their day. This can be herding livestock, horseback riding, hiking in the mountains or on the beach, mountain biking, playing extended games of fetch, or agility games. They are incredibly smart and love to learn tricks and solve problems. Be sure that you research this breed carefully before committing to living with a herding dog.

Buddy is a laid-back boy of 3 years and 45 lbs looking for a forever home.
Buddy - a low-rider hunk boy is the best way to describe him. Buddy could also stand to lose a few lbs. He's pretty chill and loves to carry around his toys in his mouth. His favorite things are humans and toys (in no particular order). He is fine with other dogs too but humans and toys are TOP OF HIS LIST. He walks well on leash and rides well in the car.
Buddy is housebroken, crate trained, neutered, up-to-date on vaccines and preventives, and microchipped. He was recently cleared by the vet after heartworm treatment.
We are a foster-based rescue organization with foster homes throughout the state of Florida.

Oklahoma dogs are not available to adopters who live in an apartment.

Blu came to GPRO from an Oklahoma kill shelter suffering from Parvo and very emaciated. He spent his first week in the ICU, and is now fully recovered - he's healthy, enjoying his carefree puppyhood, and ready to find his fur-ever home! Blu is a Great Pyrenees/Husky and/or Great Dane mix. Beyond his strikingly gorgeous blue eyes and good looks Blu is confident, social, happy-go-lucky, and very smart. He is house trained, crate trained, a great leash walker, a good car rider, knows some basic obedience commands, and is well-mannered for his young age. He loves attention, looooves toys and playing fetch and tug-of-war, chasing the water from the water hose, hunting bugs in the yard, playing with dog buddies, and taking siestas stretched out on his back. This little social butterfly is looking for an active family that will provide him the continued, proper raising, enrichment and training he will need. He would be best in a home with older kids as he's an athletic yet super clumsy pup that is also mouthy. Blu would enjoy a home with a fun-loving dog friend or two.

Blu has received all three rounds of puppy vaccines, and is microchipped, dewormed, utd on prev meds, and neutered. Submit your adoption application at www.nationalpyr.org to adopt this love bug! Blu is fostered in the Tulsa area; all meet & greets at the foster home are scheduled once your application is processed. All GPRO adopted puppies under 6 mo old are required to be enrolled in a puppy level obedience class within 30 days of adoption. This is to insure this giant breed is successfully raised to be a good dog citizen, and is manageable and well-mannered when fully grown. We highly recommend all adopted dogs regardless of age attend an obedience class as it is a great way for adopters to bond with their new dog, continue building the dog's level of manners and skill set, have a local, professional resource, and also offer enrichment and socialization for the dog."

Winter is approximately 2 years old and weighs about 60 lbs. 

BACKGROUND:  This pretty girl ended up in rescue after her person passed away suddenly leaving her with no one to take care of her. Understandably, Winter is a little lost and confused, but we are going to help this girl find her person again. Could that be you? We are not sure of her past life with her previous owner but we suspect that she may have been shaved at one time as her fur is starting to come back in as well.  

LIKES:  She loves to have her ears scratched, chase balls and, yes! Do zoomies when she is excited, even in the living room! She initially is excited on her walks and will pull on the leash. She is learning that pulling makes the walking stop and is making progress. She is decompressing & settling in the new environment. Winter is a great traveler in the car and loves to go where ever you may be headed. 

Winter is looking for someone who can spoil her and give her all the attention she needs. She enjoys attention & will throw paw to ask for it. She prefers to be the only dog in the home.

He was understandably confused but he seems to not be phased at all about his past life. Just a happy pup seeking a new life and home. Murry is ready to work for a treat and bond with his human.  

Murry is strong and all puppy. He seems to be missing basic manners that were never taught in his previous home. He acts more like a 3-month-old pup who likes to frolic and doesn't know his own strength. He is built like a tank & would love to learn how to pull a sled or go on a nice hike. He reminds us of the famous Balto. 

Typical puppy, he has energy to burn, but with regular exercise & mental stimulation, he is a happy good boy. Murry is eager to have a home, continue positive dog training and be loved. He walks nicely on a leash, will roll over for belly rubs and is ready to lean on you for some love. He knows sit makes good things happen & has so much potential. He is food motivated.

CHILDREN:  We are working with Murry to sit when meeting new people, but due to his strength & size, he has the potential to knock over small children. We believe a home with older kids is best. 

CRATES: Murry is not fond of crates; therefore, he will need a gated area for a den for his own space. We recommend a tall toddler gate & a fenced-in yard. He loves toys and will run around and play by himself by throwing them in the air, who doesn't like to play catch? 

OTHER DOGS:  He has done well meeting friendly female dogs so he may be able to live with another female that is around the same age.

Mason is a quirky guy. He is a 50 pound husky with a lapdog mentality. He will love you unconditionally and be your best friend. He loves to give kisses and is starting to do pretty well at the sit command. He plays hard and naps even harder. He does great at night, He has slept in both his bed, at the base of the bed, and up in bed with people. It just depends on his mood that night. He loves bones and jerky treats are his favorite. He likes his dinner wet, so we put some wet food on top of his dry food. He is also doing pretty good on a leash. We have been working with him and are seeing improvement. He does get excited when he sees other dogs. He will continue to be trained to be focused while walking, but overall does pretty well on a leash. He will need someone who has time to spend with him during the day or another dog to help keep him company when nobody is home since he does get very anxious being home alone. Fireworks and loud noises don't scare him however. We will send him with his crate, treats, a few toys, his harness, and his leash. His breed is known for high energy and needing a lot of exercise. He is doing great in his foster home. He loves kids and has even met and done well with cats.

All of the dogs/cats listed are located in or near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Adoption fees are $195 for dogs ($95 for Seniors 7 years+) and $60 for adult cats, $75 for kittens (under 6 months) and $25 for senior cats (7 years+) to help cover vet bills for spay/neuter of all adoptable pets as well as getting them up-to-date on their basic vaccinations, and for starting heartworm and flea/tick preventatives. No pet will be officially adopted without being spayed/neutered and vaccinated (unless there are health risks in doing so).

We will require an approved on-line application which is available on our website at ForeverLoveRescue.com. If you are looking for a dog, be prepared for a Meet-and-Greet and a basic home check to be done on or before adoption day, to ensure that the dog can be safe in the new home and that everyone involved is comfortable with each other.

HI, I'M DIEGO! DO YOU LOVE TO SNUGGLE AND PLAY? ME TOO!

It seems this sweet boy spent the beginning of his life living outdoors at the end of a chain. Oh, how Diego has blossomed in foster care! He adores people of all ages, including children, and and absolutely craves attention. He may be a little too enthusiastic for small children, so care will need to be taken in that regard. Diego hasn't gotten the memo that he's larger than your average lap dog, as he loves to get as close as possible to snuggle and offer pittie kisses.

This very smart pup will sit, shake, down and rollover on command; we're still working on 'stay' and 'come.' His leash manners could use some polishing, although a proper harness and additional training will be beneficial. Diego has excellent car manners and will often nod off in the passenger seat. Toys rock his world and this silly guy is always ready to romp and play. He'll chase a ball all day long but hasn't gotten the hang of returning it to you just yet. While Diego shares nicely with humans, he's not inclined to share toys, treats or food with other dogs and may act out in an aggressive manner. He's housebroken and crate trained in foster care and may just need a refresher course in his new home, as he gets the hang of a new routine.

Diego does not do well with dogs who make him feel challenged or threatened. He needs to be your one and only. He's also not a fan of kitties and there can be no cats in his home. If you can offer Diego the exercise, playtime and loving care he craves, he's ready to make your acquaintance. A fenced yard is would be ideal. He's had some hard knocks in life, but Diego has shaken off the dust and is ready for his happily-ever-after to begin.

She looks to have a couple different breeds in her. Corgi and rottie is what she looks like, but she only weighs 25 pounds, so maybe corgi and a small shepherd? She was rescued from the river bed in south Phoenix last year. She was so scared and so shy at the beginning, we don't think anyone had ever touched her kindly. She was maybe even a wild dog. She adores guys now,Â but has never been able to warm up to a woman. We think she must have been abused by a woman and it does not seem like she will ever get over that. With guys however, she will hang out with them, follow them around, and let them pick herÂ up and hold her after she earns their trust. She is a totally different dog with men. She is sweet and loving and seeks out their affection. She really needs an all male house. She is potty trained and kennel trained. At home in her own environment she is confident and does great, but she is still not interested in walks or car rides. With the right person we are hoping she will work up to that 1 day. This poor little girl seems to have been through a lot in her life and will take some understanding from her new owners. She just wants to hang out at home with her people she trusts. She enjoys being outside and feels like she has a job patrolling the yard. She gets along with other dogs and enjoys their company, but would also be fine by herself. She likes to chase cats, so no cats. She tries for the birds but her legs are too short to jump high enough to catch them.

As she was being rescued, she went into labor and delivered 5 beautiful, healthy babies. GiGi was a great Mom to her precious babies and were adopted. GiGi was scared to death of everything and has now finally begun to trust humans again. She deserves her own home where she can live the life of the happy girl she is now. She will need a special home that has the time to give her that she will need to settle in and feel safe. She is still scared of loud noises and any fast movement. It takes her a few days to feel safe around new people. There can not be any young children in her home as they would terrify her. GiGi wants to find her forever home and hopes you are looking for her, too. She loves to be around her person and will lay by you as long as you pet her. Please consider this very deserving little girl.  You must be in or very near the Louisville, Ky. area to adopt Gigi. Her perfect home would be with an older woman that is home a lot of the time. You must have puppy mill experience to be considered for this dog.

This dog requires an above ground structural fence for adoption. If you do not have one, do not apply for this dog. Please read her bio, if you do not live in or near Louisville, have no prior puppy mill experience or do not have a fenced yard, do not email me asking if any or all of the requirements are negotiable, they are not.

My name is Sedrick and I am looking for someone to love me. Someone who needs me as much as I need them. It has been over a year since I have been rescued and I am longing to find
my forever home.

I am a 5 year old mix. Since we don't know my actual birthday my foster gave me a birthday of Valentine's Day because I have so much love to give!!

I am a medium energy boy. I love to go for walks and I play with my toys, but I also love to be inside with you, just lounging by your side.

I love to smile! I am such a happy boy.... I love to give kisses and I really adore children! I
am a big boy, though, so I will do best with older children (10+).

I need a home where I can be the only pet, as I'm not always good with other dogs. At some point, with proper intros, I may be o.k. with a friend, but for now will do best as the only dog
in the home.

I am already neutered, micro-chipped, and up to date on my vaccines. I'm also already
housebroken AND crate trained. I am a VERY well behaved boy!!

If you are interested in making me a part of your family and giving me my
forever home please contact Michele Rose for more information. I will give you companionship and love for the rest of my life!!

*Application, adoption fee, and home visit required. Sedrick is located in Pine, AZ (just outside of Payson) and transport is available.

My Name is Mario. I came to my foster home in Central Ohio all the way from a shelter in Portage County. The shelter thought I would be better suited to be with Speak because they specialize in special need animal rescue. Oh yea, did I mention? I am deaf. But don't worry, that just makes me special, not different because I get to learn sign language. Right now, I know sit and come. I am eager to find my new family who will teach me more signs.

I like to run around too and play with other girl dogs. I am okay with boy dogs if girls aren't around. I am a gentleman and I like tend to be protective of girl dogs. My foster mom says I am what some people might call a \""velcro\"" dog. I love to follow my foster mom from room to room and be by her at all times. I mean really, who doesn't like to hang out on the couch with their foster momma and watch TV?

I forgot to mention, I am great with kids too! I am okay with cats...I do like to sneak and get their food though. But I have to say I am super sweet boy and probably the most loyal dog on earth. I also give the best hugs. Hopefully we will have a chance to hang out sometime and I will give you one."

Tate is about 8-years old, she weigh 65lbs, and she is housetrained and loves to go on walks.. She can stand to lose a few pounds, and is learning to sit, down and wait.

Tate would be best as an only dog, she is not a dog park dog, but enjoys going on walks, snuggling on the couch and sleeping close to you. She is a perfect girl when company comes over, and she has excellent house manners!  She is strong so she would be best with no young kids, but she is gentle and not a barker like most hound dogs! Tateâs ideal family would be a single adult or couple, she is great with men and women, and like most hounds, she needs to live in a house. She just wants to be the center of attention and loved. For the right family Tate will be your best friend, she doesnât need much, a bowl of food, a walk and a best friend. Is that you?

The Canadian adopter had until Christmas to get him back here for HW treatment, and has not returned him, and has had the adoption fee returned, since he is coming back. So the rescue has a breached adoption contract, no adoption fee, no proof / paperwork from the other vet, or Mr Rebel. Who does this, refuses to get his HW treatment done? (IF Rebel is HW positive, he came here that way.)Since he has not been returned to rescue, he is a stolen dog. 12-2-17 Rebel has a meet and greet scheduled. 8-8-17 Rebel King comes into rescue as Senior owner surrender. (Both are seniors) The reason given was that the vet would not put him down, and it was suggested that he give me a call. The only complaint was that the dog would sometimes circle-growl-nip at the owner when he poured his coffee in the morning, until the owner went to his office.

Little did they remember that I had been contacted back in August of 2015 about him and did ask for him. However, they decided against it, even though they had already sent him intact to Canada to be a stud dog thru social media. (Poor Flex, he is very scared of his own shadow, so he must have been so very sad.)Fast forward to December 4, 2016 and it was explained that they had tried numerous times to rehome him and Flex would not take to anyone. Well, here we are....Flex is now between 2 and 3 and has been through some pretty horrible stuff. I can't even call it ignorance, since they did have an alternative over a year ago. I so wish I had him then. Flex will require a fenced in yard and quiet household where he can learn to trust again, at his own pace.

7-9-15 Mya comes into rescue as an owner surrender, due to her being deaf and finding out after the fact that she is three legged due to an injury at 3 months old which the breeder did not treat. The owner did not know she was deaf when she got her, supposedly. So then, the rescue only gets part of the story as well. Then the paperwork and x-rays are withheld. It seems that FHO surgery was done at 8 months old. Yet, it did not heal correctly and no rehab was done. So, at 14 months old, the rescue had the FHO Repair surgery done for her. Finding out the morning of the surgery, that she also has a luxating patella, grade 4, which (according to that particular vet) will also need repair after the hip is healed. The rescue had two more opinions, after her FHO surgery, and both of those vets (who we have previously worked with and trust more than the one(s) who did the surgery) agreed that taking off the knee cap and reattaching (because of the previous neglect) could make her unable to use her leg at all and make it worse. Therefore, we are opting to let her be the dog as she is very happy now.

We are listing him to help with his rehoming as a courtesy to his current owners.

If you are interested in finding out more about him, please contact the person listed at the end of the following set of notes (provided by his owner, Kenny):

His name is Yeti and his information is below:

1. He is 5 and his birthday is in November. He weighs about 65lbs.
2. He is Neutered. When I brought him back from South Korea, the Korean government required him to be neutered in Order to export him.
3. He is up to date on vaccinations as of May of this year.
4. He is not treated monthly for anything, as none of those are currently in my area and there are no signs of anything.
5. No known issues. Last Vet check was beginning of 2018 when I moved from Vegas to northern Reno.
6. He behaves normally around all. He doesnât like to be âtrapped/blockedâ in. I currently have him around my 2 other dogs whom my ex wife is taking. He is also around other animals from my ex wifeâs mom.
7. Normal routine consists of pretty much outside all day. I live on 40 acres and he runs around it all. He exercises outside all day with the other dogs. He only eats once a day, and it is currently at night around 2000 hours.
8. He is both an inside and outside dog. Does great with both.
9. He knows sit, down, come. He pulls slightly on a leash, but nothing over the top. When he sees other dogs, he is just curious. Wants to smell and normal stuff dogs do.
10. He likes to be pet and loved. The only sensitive part is his tail. When we found him in Korea, he had a rubber band around his tail. The doctors had to cut it to make it healthy. That is the only part about him that is sensitive. You can see it in the photos.
11. He rides in cars fine. Back of trucks too. He hates the vet. Doesnât like to get shots, but it is possible. Can be lifted. Just marks his territory a lot.
12. He has not bitten anybody or any other animals that I am aware of. I just came back from overseas after a year, and my ex wife didnât say anything.
13. No separation anxiety or behavioral issues that I know of. He is kennel trained and dog door trained.
14. I adopted Yeti while I was stationed in Korea. I rescued him from a meat market. He has had all American veterinary care in Korea and well as in the states. Up to date on all shots. The reason Iâm rehoming him is because I got divorced right before my deployment and now that I am back, with the divorce and child support, I can no longer keep a place that can an animal can accompany me. I have to downsize my current lifestyle and living expenses in order to keep my head above water. I have had Yeti since 2014 when he turned 1.

Shelton is a gorgeous Yorkie mix who is around two years old and fully grown at 19 pounds.  This beautiful boy came to us from a rural southwestern Virginia shelter after being found as a stray.

Sadie is a darling little Yorkie who is about 8 years old.  She came to us with another older gal after her owner died, and the extended family was not able to keep them.  Both were in pretty sad shape with horrible skin which we were told was allergies, but good hygiene and nutrition, plus flea eradication, has allowed the skin to completely clear.  Paperwork from the previous veterinarian indicates that most care was declined.

Since coming to our rescue Sadie has been spayed, had a mammary tumor (benign) removed and tested, been given a dental cleaning with extractions, been given all vaccines, had extensive blood testing to make certain there were no underlying conditions and been microchipped.  With good care and her small size, Sadie should live a very long time and enjoy life!  Sadie loves being a lap dog.  We are seeking a quiet and predictable home for her since that is what she is used to.

Guthrie is a beautiful pure-bred male pug who appears to be around 2 years old.  He came to us from a rural southwestern Virginia shelter where he had been found as a stray and never reclaimed.

This little guy was born sometime around Easter, and he is thought to be a Yorkie mix. He is expected to stay small and be less than 20 pounds fully grown.

Mickey is a precious little fellow who was born sometime around the first of the year.  He came to us with his littermate, Minnie, from a home in southern VA where neither was given any human handling or socialization.  Although both are very sweet, they are skittish and each will need a home with a patient owner able to provide a consistent schedule and lots of human interaction.  We expect Mickey to be less than 10 pounds when fully grown.

Mickey is in good health.  He has had his puppy vaccines and will be neutered and microchipped as a part of our adoption process.

Zeb, and his sibling, Zach, recently came to us from a local shelter under quarantine as they had been exposed to parvo.  They were part of a hoarding situation in a nearby rural county.  Our vet worked hard with anti-viral medications to try to keep the boys safe, and we are excited to report that their immune systems were able to protect them!  They are now looking for homes where they can be the center of attention and beloved pets.  The boys are thought to have been born in late spring and will most likely be 25-30 pounds when fully grown.

Flash is a rare beautiful blue merle male chihuahua who is 1-2 years old.  He came to us from a local shelter partner after being surrendered by his owner.  This little fellow has been passed from owner to owner and has understandably developed some separation anxiety issues that caused the current owner to feel unable to properly care for him.  In his short time with us we see a wonderful dog who would do very well in a home with an experienced dog owner that has a very predictable schedule.  Once Flash has someone he can trust, a routine he can count on and some TLC, he will be a wonderful pet!

Flash is in good health.  As a part of our rescue protocols, Flash will have all vaccinations, blood tests, a microchip implant and neuter surgery.

Daphne is a darling female chihuahua who recently came to us from a regional shelter in a nearby rural community.  We have little information about her, but we know she and several other chihuahuas were taken from a hoarding situation.  Daphne appears to be one of the lucky ones who has had some level of human socialization and is not fearful of people.  We believe she is a younger adult, and are still gathering information about her.

Daphne likes adults who are kind and patient.  She is quick with a wag of the tail and to give kisses. We believe that she will thrive in a patient home without larger animals, and she will begin to understand the joy of being a beloved pet.  Delilah appears to be a healthy girl.  She will be given her vaccinations and will be spayed and microchipped as a part of her adoption process.

Chyna is again available for adoption!  This beautiful girl originally came to us in April in medical distress.  She had ingested corn cobs and was unable to pass them.  Her owners were unable to afford to provide her with the life-saving surgery she needed, and they surrendered her to our veterinarian.  We were happy to be able to work with our vet (who we think is just the most awesome vet ever, by the way) to provide for Chyna's immediate surgery on a Saturday afternoon.  We then had Chyna vaccinated, spayed and microchipped, and in May she was adopted.  Sadly her adopted family had a job change and she has returned to our care.

We believe Chyna is getting close to a year old now, and she is a big, beautiful, happy, gentle girl.  She is in great health, and she has been housebroken while with her last family.  We are seeking a home for Chyna with knowledgable and responsible owners able to handle a large dog.  Because she is a young lady, she will need an adopter able to properly exercise her.  We would love an active adopter for her!  Chyna has not been recently weighed.  Our best guess is that she is about 50 pounds now.

Blossom is a two year old chihuahua mix who came to CARE from a local shelter.  She was surrendered by an owner who was no longer able to care for her.  The owner stated that Blossom was housebroken, slept in the bed, loved riding in the car and playing with squeaky toys and was a joy to own.  The only negative mentioned was that Blossom can be an escape artist so will need a secure home.  She is fully grown at about 15 pounds. we believe she may have some Jack Russell terrier in her, as she behaves as one does.

As a part of her adoption process, Blossom has received all her vaccines and has had blood tests to rule out heart worms and tick borne illnesses.  This coming week she will be spayed and microchipped.  We believe she will make an awesome addition to most families, especially those who are active.

Introducing Rigby, a cute little mixed breed dog who is about 3 years old and fully grown at 15 pounds.    The first question most people ask is what the breed of the dog is, and the truth is, we haven't a clue!  We see dachshund, Jack Russell terrier, pug and chihuahua, but your guess is as good as any!  Rigby is a happy, healthy dog who would love to have a home of his own!

Rigby is in good health.  He has been neutered and microchipped, given all his vaccines and has had blood tests to rule out heart worms and tick borne illness.  Rigby will do best in a home with experienced pet owners who have a secure environment.  He is good with other dogs his age, but may be better suited to a home without small children.

Rhett is a beautiful male Redbone hound who our vet believes is 5-6 years old.  This sweet fellow was found in a rural southern VA county as a stray and was totally emaciated, having been on his own for some time, most likely.  Since coming to CARE we have helped him to put on weight and feel loved.  He is a very nice dog who is looking for a family willing to share their home and hearts.

Rhett is in otherwise good health.  He has been given all his vaccines and has had blood tests.  We are very excited to share that he tested negative for heartworms!  He did test positive for erlichia and lyme, both spread by ticks, and we have provided treatment for both.  Rhett will be neutered and microchipped as a part of our adoption process.  He will make a wonderful addition to most any home!

Rico is friendly and confident, loves everyone he meets, and loves playing with other dogs of all sizes. He has never met a cat that we know of so he would have to meet any resident kitties before an adoption can be approved. He is full of energy and loves to play and run.

Dyno is a 3 year old lab mix who weighs approx 54 lbs. We aren't sure about his past as we saved him from Rowan County AC.  He is very sweet and loves to cuddle. He wants to be a lap dog. Dyno is still learning what's allowed and what's not. His foster is helping teach him.  He wants so badly to please his humans. He simply needs obedience and structure to help him succeed. We would love to see him in a home where he is the only dog. He is dog selective. We're not sureHe would also do best in a home without other dogs, or where he can be separated from other dogs. Dyno loves children. His best fit would be with older children as he loves his toys and older kids would know which toys are his. 

He is working on his social skills. He still gets anxious, and scared in public places. 

This sweet baby deserves a chance to learn from someone willing to help him. We will gladly help in this process by offering some training for a foster or adopter. He needs help this week. Please share this post. We know someone reading it will help. We pay for everything. You can start as a foster to adopt.

Inde is housebroken and knows basic commands (sit, down, stay and come). She also loves to swim. Inde gets a little protective over her food so they were fed separately but otherwise get along together great. Inde can be picky about her doggie friends particularly ones that are high energy/aggressive ones but she is otherwise a great family dog. Inde weighs about 60 pounds and is 6 years old. She is spayed and up to date on her vaccinations.

She was set to be euthanized. We pulled her and put her in a foster home. She was a littler nervous at first, but warmed up slowly. She gave her foster mom and dad kisses the entire ride home from the shelter. She was grateful.. Tovi is 2.5 years old. She is mixed breed. Not sure what breed she is. We took her to the vet and she is HW POSITIVE. So we are preparing her for the fast kill HW treatment. She is on antibiotics now to prep her body for the treatment. She is currently on Nexgard and Heartgard. She is UTD on all shots, microchipped, rabies. Since we have had her in foster, we have learned that she is not good with cats. She LOVES other dogs, but chases cats. We are looking for a home that is cat free. She will need to be in a home that can keep her calm during her treatments in Sept. Tovi is available for adoption as well. All treatments are being paid for by NHR. Her current foster mom said she's so good in the house. She is so chill and sat in the kitchen while she cooked and was a go with the flo kinda girl. She can play tough and rough with the other dogs in the yard.

Sheâs a strong-willed, loving, energetic girl who gives everything her all. Her favorite things to do are playing fetch (especially in the water like Tahoe or a pool!), snuggling up to her humans, sunbathing in a backyard or under a window, watching TV very attentively, riding shotgun in the car, and exploring the neighborhood on walks. Sheâs super attuned to her humansâ moods. She loves attention and is very attentive herself.

 Pânut was originally a rescue (I got her 3 years ago) who Iâm guessing wasnât socialized very well and therefore is pretty anxious in certain situations. Sometimes sheâll act nervous and growl/bark at new people (sheâs never bitten a person) until she gets comfortable or, more rarely, goes into timeout to calm down. She has struggled with resource guarding which can be addressed through training that I unfortunately donât have time or energy for. Over the years, she has bitten two dogs (whoâve lived with her and was otherwise friendly with) when they have tried to take her ball or food. She sometimes gets into stuff she shouldnât (mostly food and fun stuff like cardboard) when sheâs left alone too long or when sheâs bored. This can be solved by moving things out of her reach and/or more training.

An ideal home would have someone who can walk her daily and play fetch in the backyard or at a dog park frequently. Ideally they wouldnât be away at work all day, or if they are, there are others who can check in on her or give her attention throughout the day.

 I know in my heart of hearts that Pânut is a good girl who just wasnât taught how to deal with her anxiety. She has made so much progress over the few years Iâve lived with her and Iâm so proud of her! Everyone she meets can tell sheâs so full of love that she just wants to share with everyone - especially through licks and cuddles.

Application to meet Frankie at www.chowsplus.org

Meet sweet boy Frankie!  He is such a handsome mix weighing 52 lbs. Frankie is a sweet playful boy who knows sit, shake, and down. He LOVES playing with other dogs so a home with a playmate for Frankie would be great. 
A home without cats is needed since Frankie is a little too interested in them.
We are not positive on his breed. He may be a mix of husky, akita and chow.
He is very friendly and has been fine with kids ages 11 and up.

Frankie is a smart boy that learns quickly. He is house trained, rides great in the car, loves to be with people and around 2 years old. He is neutered, microchipped and vaccinated and ready for his new forever home.  He is located in Sacramento. If you are interested in meeting him you can submit an application at:

Snoopy is friendly with everyone he meets but will likely be a good watchdog as well. I KNOW that Snoopy will be great with young children; he met two kids (ages 8 & 10) and was literally melting in their arms. Snoopy is very affectionate and loves to snuggle right next to you in bed.

Snoopy gets along fine with other dogs, but he does have a prey drive and doesn't seem to know what a little dog is; therefore, I am seeking a home with no small dogs. (I'm confident that once he realized that little dogs are indeed dogs, he'd be fine with them.) Snoopy prefers to receive attention from humans much more so than from other dogs, so he'd be fine as an only dog.

I have not seen Snoopy around cats, but since he went after a Chihuahua mix, I can't consider a home with cats for him.

Snoopy is housetrained and never had an accident in the house he's in, but he does occasionally get his paws up on the counter if there is food present. He responds well to the \""sit\"" and \""lie down\"" commands, so apparently he's received some obedience training in his young life. 

Snoopy walks very well on leash and rides calmly in a vehicle. He apparently enjoys water, as he took to the pond at GSRSV's rescue ranch fairly quickly.

Snoopy gets his name from his long snout and the somewhat comical overbite in his muzzle. I'm not sure if his overbite originates from another canine breed (Collie?) but it does not affect his ability to eat normally. 

GSRSV rescued Snoopy from the Stanislaus County Shelter on 6-23-18. He had been at the shelter since May 12; I imagine that he was a staff favorite at the shelter. Nonetheless, his time had run out and he was going to be euthanized so GSRSV appealed for donations to board Snoopy until he could be transferred to a no-kill shelter out of state. Three women came forward with donations to cover his boarding expense. (Thank you Danielle Blount, Diana Cheung and Alicia Navarro!) When I discovered what a sweet dog Snoopy is, I searched for and was able to find a foster home for him so that he wouldn't have to go back to a shelter. 

Snoopy is located in Sacramento. His adoption fee is $210."

-a completed Adoption Application (found under the âApplication Formsâ tab)
-previous or current Samoyed breed experience
-all pets in home must be spayed/neutered and current on vaccines
-approved adoptions must be completed in person. We do not ship or transport dogs; you must come to our shelter to adopt a Samoyed.
-Adult dogs require another dog(s) in the home to help them adjust and feel more comfortable.

Please call the Humane Society of North Iowa at 641-423-6241 for more information.

Adoption fee covers the following veterinarianÂ services: spay/neuter surgery, age appropriateÂ vaccinations, flea and dewormer treatment, feline leukemia/FIV test in cats, and heartworm test for dogs."

We went to a San Antonio Rampage hockey game, and there he was, under our car at the SBC Center when we went to leave. We just had to take him home. He was very skinny and hungry and very scared. We brought him home October 26, 2013. He looks like a lab, but is not quite as big as most of the labs I have had. and his is brown with a white patch on his tummy. But my guess would be he has some lab in him. When we took him to the vet the following week, he estimated he was probably around 4 months old. So we approximate his birthday July-ish of 2013. Rampage still shows some signs of being abandoned or hurt by whomever left him in the SBC center parking lot. It took him a while to get used to people, and he scarfs down every drop of food when it hits the bowl. After being with us for almost 4 years, he has become very loving and comfortable. He is still scared of new people. He does not show aggression toward them at all, he just runs away and hides. However, he does show affection toward frequent visitors, such as our parents, siblings, and nieces & nephews. So we are confident he will become comfortable is his new home quickly. He does still eat all his food immediately, so we do not free feed him. He eats once a day and eats every drop immediately.  He is great with other dogs- submissive"

Hawkeye came from a severe hoarding case in San Miguel County, but right from the start he wanted to follow and be with people. He is a bit of a goofball, acting silly and playful quite often.  He has shown great manners with dogs and enjoys playing with polite dogs.  Hawkeye is still polishing his house manners.  He has likely had to be resourceful, so he tends to pick up items and carry them around, and is learning what a crate means. He is showing he is a quick study with house training.  Hawkeye really wants to belong to a pack and would like a home where someone is around more often than not.  Hawkeye is about 6 years old and we guess he is mixed breed of Rottweiler, Shar Pei, and other breeds.  He will fill out with good nutrition at about 90 pounds.  

Come meet this big dog with the big heart at adoption events.  Or inquire at julie@hart2heartcanine.com or call 703-254-6582"

I came to Homeward Trails from Scott County. I have been looking for my furever home for awhile now but for some reason, no one has grabbed me yet. My fosters think it may be because my fur i s little sparse and patchy but they assure me that there are plenty of people that won't judge me for that. I swear, my fur is looking better and growing out every day! I hear there is a saying that goes something like \""don't judge a book by its cover\"" that applies well to me. Now, here are some of my favorite things: food, treats, naps, laying outside, sun bathing, butt scratches, chasing balls and playing fetch, and playing with other friendly dogs. Some things that are not my favorite things: Walks with lots of loud noises and baths. My ideal home would be with happy, calm, laid back people. I am fine if my people decided to have a kitty(ies) before me because I only show a mild interest in them and give them plenty of space. I would love to have a doggy brother or sister because they can reassure me when things may get scary. I would do best in a home has a fenced backyard for me to do my business in peace. It is scary to go to the bathroom when something could jump out at you at any moment! I don't jump on the furniture without permission and I love to just rest on my bed inside the house. Oh, I am a super good boy about not going to the bathroom in the house and sleeping in my crate at night! I do not like to get into the car but once I am inside I don't mind car rides. Well, what do you think? Could you be my soulmate?\"" This guy is a champ that truly deserves a loving home where he can show what a great dog he is. Older children who are good with dogs would be best because loud noises can still be somewhat disturbing for Johnny. Do you have the patience and love to give Johnny the forever home he deserves?

I am a sweet and loving 6-year-old (could be younger) black & white pittie-mix girl who was saved from a California shelter in late December. I've been waiting too long in a kennel! My favorite thing to do is go for walks! I get so excited when I know it's my turn for my walk that I wag my tail and cry! I also have perfect leash manners. I am very shy at first once I know you, I warm up quickly. I love to be cuddled and petted and would be a perfect partner when it's time to watch a movie.

I did well on my dog test with large dogs, with a slow introduction. I'm not a fan of cats, though!

I am spayed, up-to-date on my shots, and weigh 49 lbs. only. Can you foster or adopt me?

Animal Profile: Brigid is a 4- to 5-year-old female Boxer/Pit/German Shepherd mix (we had her DNA done) who was rescued in California. She is our rescue's longest resident and we're still looking for the right fur-ever home for her. She loves all people and is amazing with even very young children. She doesn't bat an eye at crazy antics or rough handling by toddlers, and is not mouthy whatsoever. All she wants in life is to be next to her people. Snuggling and following you around are her favorite activities. Brigid is crate trained and can be left crated for 8 hours without issue in a secure crate. She's house trained and knows sit, down and \""kennel up.\"" She's not mouthy or food/toy possessive, and she takes treats gently. Brigid is anxious and reactive in the outside world, and needs slow introductions to dogs she doesn't know. She is leash reactive except when managed by an experienced handler, and will never be a dog-park dog. But she loves playing and cuddling with dogs of all genders and sizes in her own pack and will be fine living with other dogs after a slow introduction. (She needs to understand they are part of her pack before she accepts them.) Brigid doesn't need or want to go for walks for exercise but she does need a secure fenced yard to go potty. Bonus skill: She is treadmill trained!

Brigid's Story: Brigid was a stray in San Bernardino and ended up at high-kill shelter. She was put on the euthanasia list when she came down with kennel cough, so we rescued her in September 2016! She was not spayed due to her upper respiratory infection and when she arrived we quickly saw she was very pregnant! After giving birth she ended up with a very serious infection that required separating her from pups so she could get the veterinary care she needed. She had to have her mammary gland removed and was in intensive medical care for some time. This was likely traumatic for her and may explain some of her separation anxiety and excited/reactive behavior around other dogs. Since then, Brigid had an injury which required surgery (TPLO) and has since recovered. She has also had an extensive board and train so she is well trained. We are eager to find Brigid a wonderful home she can call her own. She has been through a lot so she will need a patient, loving and supportive family.

Adoption Info: Brigid's adoption fee of $150 includes her spay, all vaccinations (Rabies, DPPV, Bordetella) deworming, microchipping and transport from California to Seattle. Brigid's adoption will also include a home training session for her new adopters. Brigid's actual rescue costs are close to $10,000 so any donations to her care are greatly appreciated.

About Foster to Adopt Program:
Fosters provide a safe landing spot for dogs transitioning from the shelter environment and help prepare the dogs for adoption. You provide the love and structure, and we take care of everything else! We cover all vet care, and drive the adoption process. Average length of foster is 2-3 weeks. Fosters do get first consideration for adoption, if desired.

Macy came from a rural part of Kentucky where she was live-trapped after being born to a pack of Shepherds that were free-roaming on a farm. Macy had zero human contact prior to being trapped and has been very slow to warm up. She is considered semi-feral at this point and is still overcoming her fears. 

Macy prefers to avoid all human contact but has begrudgingly learned how to walk on a leash and tolerate being handled for daily living. Macy is a fear biter and if cornered - such as when she is in her crate and needs to come out - she will lash out in fear. If you move slowly with Macy she settles down and will allow you to handle her but she gets overwhelmed easily when rushed. Macy is going to require extensive ongoing handling, training, and socialization coupled with lots of patience as she continues to grow and bond. 

Macy connects with other dogs much better than she does people as a result of her early life in a pack. She does well meeting new dogs and is quick to follow their lead. She isn't at a place of comfort that she plays often but every now and then she will forget the people are around and start to play with one of the other young dogs. Macy has not been around cats or small dogs although she is relatively small herself. We do not know how she would do as there is not true way to test her given her discomfort on leash. 

Macy has a sweet soul and is trying her best to overcome her fears and bond with the people around her. Macy is searching for a home that can provide her a stable environment and ongoing work as she continues to grow beyond her past. 

If you have a place in your heart and home for Macy please email Tierhavenrescue@gmail.com for an adoption application or visit adoptapet.com/tierhaven for FAQ"

A note to those looking at CPR. We have no perfect dogs - but many of our dogs have proven to be perfect for a certain someone. Our job is to find those someone's. Our most successful adopters come to CPR not because they want a dog. They come to us because they want to give a dog a home. We urge all of our potential adopters not to fall in love with a picture. While we like to know what you like in looks, a dog is more than a pretty face. Our goal is to match you with the best possible pet for you and your home. We want to create furever families.

Our descriptions contain all that we know about this dog today. We'll update as more information is known.

Are you looking to adopt within the next 30 days? If so please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and complete the application. You'll find it in the menu on the left hand side. You'll also find a total listing of all our dogs available.

Date into Rescue: 4/5/2019
Reason for being in rescue: VA shelter- allowed to run at large and picked up one too many times
Foster location: Dreamweaver Farms, Pacolet SC
Special Needs? Dood was deemed a dangerous animal in the state of Virginia. His previous owner would not keep him confined and he was allowed to roam at will. He is happy and gregarious and would run up to people and knock them down as a game. He's not shown any aggressive side to us at all but we all know how to tel him \""GET OFF\"" and he's respecting that cue. He needs some training and someone with some common sense.
Weight: 99 lbs
Height: 26 in
Spayed/Neutered: Yes

Adoption Fee: $499

Fence needed? Without exception and it needs to be a solid, dependable fence and you need to plan to be in control of your dog. He's been failed by a human once before because of not understanding our dogs needs us to keep them safe and in places they can safely be, not roaming the streets.

What kind of home would be best for me? Dood's perfect owner will be someone with dog experience, who loves to take long, brisk walks and who would enjoy teaching, shaping and training their dog to be the excellent companion this dog has the potential to be. Dood is affectionate and friendly and longs for that companion that will be his partner, his friend and his guide through life instead of letting him run amuck.

What is my personality like? Dood is an even tempered and intelligent dog who has been allowed to run and roam and that got him on serious trouble. He was part of a pack with his sister Dette.

One of our temperament programs is to take our dogs off site for adventures. Dood is a perfect gentleman in the car just as he was in the trip from Virginia to South Carolina. He is attentive, likes to look out the window and enjoys seeing new places and learning new things.

How do I act when I first meet new people? Friendly. He's been known to bark at people but it's in a \""hi come on over and let's get to know each other\"" way. But..as big as he is it is a deep bark and that can intimidate people.

Other tips and tidbits: Estimated Birthdate: 4/15/2015. Dood is a lot of dog with a lot of things going for him. He has been given a very bad rap and very nearly lost his life because his previous owner had no common sense. We are going to be extraordinarily picky about his next home to make sure it's his best home and his forever home.

Dood is NOT completely hypoallergenic. He does very lightly shed. We do not know his heritage but I am betting he is first generation so there is some shedding involved.

House trained? Dogs can be house trained if they are in the right environment and are allowed to follow a schedule as long as a physical reason doesn't keep them from being trained. A dog house trained in my home may not be in yours. We will help you teach your new dog this necessary skill and based on your schedule.

Please note - we do not ship dogs. If you are interested in adopting, please take a look at the distance between the foster home location and your location and make sure you are willing to make that trip. Most of our dogs are at our farm in Pacolet, South Carolina.

To apply, please visit our webpage at www.carolinapoodlerescue.org and visit the tab on the left that directions you to the online application.

Please note that when screening applications, we look at the entire home and then make suggestions based on what would be a good fit for your home. You are not being screened for a specific dog although we are looking to see what type of dog interests you - poodles or non poodles, color, age, etc. Others here may be a better fit for you. It is very difficult to get to know a living animal from a picture and a short description. Since we are constantly getting in new dogs, this may be a dog not in our listings yet. We want you to be very happy with your new companion and will make suggestions based on what you tell us about you.

Thank you for considering CPR."

He was adopted when a young puppy.  In early June we received a call from an animal facility in St. Louis reporting that he was with them.  He had been brought in for observation at the age of 3-1/2 years because he had nipped a child.  When the 10 days were up he was not reclaimed by the family.  
Report from the facility is that this was a play nip and there were no ER or medical or police reports filed as this was a minor and non-vicious incident.  Since his return Scooter has been in a home with several other dogs and is doing well there.  He has shown himself to be affectionate, smart, playful and certainly of good nature, although he does still nip in play occasionally.

We were not able to actually take possession of Pixie until our great vet in SI did their due diligence. The Vet staff took great care of her while she had her stay and we are grateful for their assistance in keeping her safe. She otherwise would have most likely wound up in a kill shelter.

She is underweight at 35 pounds and will require 3 meals a day. She is quiet,sleeps a lot and the only issue we have seen is some guarding of her xpen area when other dogs nose around. She's fine with other dogs but offers no interactions and turns her head away. Once we have her tuned up she will be available for adoption or long term fostering through heartworm treatment. If you are interested in Brew and have experience with English Bulldogs please contact us. PUPDATE. Brew has been with us for almost a week. She has seen our vet. Her liver values were abnormal and we have had her on supplements and will retest the 2nd week of Sept. She has gotten more energetic,is eating well, and actually is playing with some of the other dogs. She loves people and absolutely loves being pet. She is actually chasing flies!

I'm a mellow laid back guy who adores people! ADOPT FEE - FULLY VETTED: $ 75
My Story: Hi my name is Gallagher. I am a 2 1/2 and a red pittie mix. I was pulled from the Tampa kill shelter by Linda Perrigoue and sent to boarding where I am being trained by Emily. I am a good boy who sits for treats and walks well on my leash and knows basic commands.
I am unsure about other dogs and hate cats so it is best if I go to a home where I get all the love and attention. I am heartworm positive but if adopted locally in the Tampa bay area I will get treated for the heartworms for free at the Humane Society of Tampa Bay. The grant will pay $300.00 for treatment any other place. I am fully vetted and neutered and am taking heartworm preventative.
I LOVE people and balls. I put my head in your lap and love to be petted. I could play ball all day long! Because I am a young boy I would be best in a home with no small children. Could I be the special dog for you?

Emotional Support Animals (ESA)
Emotional Support Animals are not required to undergo specialized training. They can be dogs, cats, exotics, birds. Their primary role is to provide their owners with emotional comfort. Emotional support animals can benefit a disabled individual psychologically. The basic gift of companionship and unconditional affection can be the therapy needed to counter a condition like debilitating depression or Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
ESAs are protected under the Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) and the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA). People meeting the proper criteria are entitled to an ESA to assist them with life. The FHAA protects individuals by allowing ESAs to live with them regardless of breed (even with no pet policies). The ACAA protects individuals by allowing ESAs to fly with them in the cabin of an airplane without having to pay additional fees. ESAs are not required to be professionally trained. An owner can train the pet. A letter of need written by a mental health counselor may be required for those wanting to transport via plane or for landlords.

Moxie is a very loving energetic girl.  She is a terrier/cattle dog mix and about 65 lbs and about a year old. She is located in Tempe, AZ.
She is up to date on all of her shots and spayed and micro chipped.  She loves ALL other dogs and does great with even small breeds.  She does need to be in a home without small children but loves adults.  She knows commands like âsitâ and âstayâ and âlay downâ. She is a puppy so she does need more training, especially with jumping. She needs someone willing to take time with her and be patient with her and she will be the best dog. She has so much love to give.
She stays home while we are at work and is confined to the kitchen/dining room and does fine as long as the trash is put up, she is also kennel trained and does not mind spending time inside it and will sometimes put herself in it to calm down when sheâs over excited.  She also loves walks and dog parks. She needs exercise and attention and someone who can provide that for her regularly.
She does have some nervousness that is managed fairly well with regular exercise and CBD oil or treats.

He is perfection when it comes to housebreaking, sleeping all night in his dog bed (which he loves), good with other dogs (unless they jump on him) and he is just a loving soul that will bring good things to your life.

Raelynn was born on April 10, 2019 and is looking for her forever home.  We expect she will be a small / medium when full grown.

Raelynn loves playing with her siblings and toys.  She can be a bit shy at first, but warms up quickly.  Raelynn is up to date on shots, spayed, on heartworm and flea and tick prevention and is micro chipped as well.

Raelynn is not potty trained, that is something that her new family will have to work on her with.  Preference will be given to those with a physically fenced yard, but Raelynn we think will stay small enough to be suitable for apartment / townhouse living as well with the right outdoor space.

Raelynn is currently located in Tennessee and the adoption fee is $250.  Transportation may be available to out of state adopters for an additional cost depending on the area.

He was origionally adopted from the Jefferson City facility, but ended up homeless in Millersburg. We took him in and found what we thought was a good forever home. Sadly, his new owner returned him to us for an act of very insignificant behavior, she didn't like.

One thing that has made it a little difficult to find Bowser another home is that he definitely does want to be the Alpha male, so there's a good possibility he wouldn't do well in a multi-dog household. He might, however, get along well, with one female, depending on her temperament.

Bowser's adoption fee includes his neuter, regular deworming, heart-worm testing, all vaccinations (Rabies is administered by a licensed veterinarian) and a microchip. For the specific amount of adoption fees or more detailed information, you will need to contact the Shelter directly please at 573 896-4049. Thanks for looking at Bowser."

Susie is a sweet Chihuahua that found herself in a local shelter through no fault of her own. She loves going for walks and car rides. She is sensitive about being picked up due to an old injury to her shoulder/armpit. She would do best in an adult only household. Another small dog would be great.

Meet Snoopy. This sweet boy came to us as an owner surrender because his mom could no longer take care of him. FOHA to the rescue! We brought him into foster care as he awaits his second chance.

And Snoopy is a great little dog! Frisky, friendly, sweet, and absolutely adorable. He has no health issues that we know of, he gets along well with all, he has been around children and his crate trained, leash trained, and a really nice dog! We're going to get him up-to-date on shots, and he's certainly ready to find a family of his own.

Meet Paco! My best guess is that he is a Manchester terrier mix. He really wants to please you! This is a super trainable and happy guy! While he does love a good snuggle on the couch, he would probably be up for a good obedience class or even rally obedience trials. He is very attentive and loves to make you happy, and Paco has never met a stranger. He's friendly and affectionate with everyone he meets. And he's pretty cool too!

If you are looking for a little canine eye candy, this is your main man!!

I have included their intake pictures so you can appreciate how far they have come.  They went from semi-feral to sweet dogs to run to give me kisses now when they see me.

We don't know their breed or relationship, other then they are for sure a bonded pair and must go and stay together.  We think that Gideon is about 7-10 years old, and Celeste is about 5 years old. Both are fixed, heart worm negative (and on prevention), up to date on shots and micro chipped.  They are newspaper trained and have had dental cleanings done recently.

Celeste and Gideon do very well with each other, and would prefer to be the only dogs.  They are ok with some small dogs similar in size to them, but not bigger dogs.  If you have other dogs, a meet and greet is required.

You MUST have physically fenced that is very secure.  They are diggers and can Houdini their way out at their choosing.  For the most part they have remained inside and just going on newspapers for these reasons.

They travel well in a crate and are very friendly once they get to know you a bit.  They are very food motivated.  Celeste walks well on a leash, Gideon currently needs to be carried, he is not as leash savy.  Both are around the 25-30lbs mark.  Neither have any current health issues that they are being treated for.

Their ideal home would be someone who is home all day who can bond with them and vice versa.  A nice retired person or couple who is looking for some companions would be perfect.  They will need their own room/space as well so that when you go out, they are in a safe space. 

Please contact us if you would like more information about Gideon and Celeste.

Their ideal home would be someone who is home all day who can bond with them and vice versa.  A nice retired person or couple who is looking for some companions would be perfect.  They will need their own room/space as well so that when you go out, they are in a safe space. 

Please contact us if you would like more information about Gideon and Celeste.  Our email address is info@safehaventn.com and you can fill out an application on our website if you are interested in offering these 2 dogs a forever home.  They have been through a lot and have come a long way and are now socialized and ready for a forever family.  Will you be their Christmas miracle?"

My foster mom says I should be called Sweetie because that is what I am. I am 6 years old, which is a perfect age! I am not a crazy puppy, but I am still an active girl who loves to play! I was due to be euthanized and my two legged guardian angels came to my rescue. I am up to date on all of my vaccines (no cooties here). I am house, crate, and leash trained. My crate is like my own happy place. I like to go there to unwind from all of the playing. I greet everyone that I meet with a big smile and tail wag. I try to sneak a kiss in there every once in a while, but hey I like giving lovingâs. I really like to play with my four and two legged friends all day. I am great with other dogs no matter the size.  I even get along with cats (shocker I know). I am not food or toy aggressive at all. We can all share. I do know how to sit, lay down, and give paw. I do have a tiny spot on my nose that I am seeing my friends at the vet for. I will be getting it removed shortly.

I am currently located in Trenton, OH. If you would like to adopt me please go to www.sophiasgracefoundation.org and fill out the application. I cannot wait to meet my forever family and start the next chapter in my life!

She weighs 37.6 pounds and is full grown. Trooper originally came to us from Tuba City and had been found pregnant, skin and bones and covered in ticks. She has since watched all her puppies grow and find their own homes, while she was being treated for tick fever. Now she is tick fever free, has gained weight and is in great shape! This girl is very lovable and adores human touch She is house broken, and rarely barks. Trooper is cautious in new environments until she feels comfortable and trusts the people she is with. She is good on a leash but is still wary when cars pass her. Trooper is happier around smaller dogs compared to larger dogs. She will need a home with a securely fenced backyard and would benefit greatly from having a smaller canine companion to help her build her confidence. Trooper also needs a home with no pet birds, she thinks they are flying popcorn chicken and will try to snack on them!
She is spayed, up to date on vaccines, microchipped, and vet checked. Her adoption fee is $200 and includes a free vet visit and 30 days of free pet insurance. If you are interested in adopting her, please contact her foster mom Marsha at 573-690-9648.

She is a very friendly happy well-behaved girl that you canât help but love! She is potty trained, crate trained knows her obedience commands, and is an overall joy to have around. She is not pushy but loves affection. She gets along with other dogs. She listens and I canât really think of anything she has done wrong or annoying since we have had her. She came to us about 2 weeks ago. We rescued her from the Tucson county shelter. She was surrendered there by her owner who decided that living in a 55+ community was more important than her dog. She must be crazy, and Iâm secretly hoping that itâs not everything she imagined it would be. (lol) Anyway, Roxy could be yours, if you promise to love her forever!

His owners had taken him from a friend to care for him when he was found as a stray in Tucson over a year ago. When he was found, flyers were posted and attempts were made to find his original owners with no luck. They kept him and took great care for him over the course of a year until he landed here with us.

He is so sweet and likes to try to climb up on you to be pet, and will rest his head in your lap if he thinks he isn't getting enough attention. For the most part he is very curious and affectionate. He does great with other dogs too! He has been to the dog park frequently and loves to run and play. He also loves food and treat, and will get super excitable when you offer him treats! He knows how to sit for them too.

With his excitability, we would recommend no children under the age of 10 for this guy. We also think he would do best in a house that has another dog, and where he isn't left alone for too long, as he is very social and just wants companionship and love.

Please let us know if you are interested in giving Artie a forever home!

Zulu is an older, medium sized cattle dog mix who is affectionate, loyal, hyper-aware and active. She loves to go on walks and hikes with her humans, chew on her Nylabones and rawhide treats, as well as spend time with her fellow dogs and cats. Zulu is very good with children and other animals (she is reluctant to get to know larger dogs, but has so in the past). 

Zulu dislikes loud, sudden noises and busy areas. This tends to lead to excessive barking. She also dislikes being separated from her humans and prefers to hang out with them all the time! 

At the moment, Zulu's current owners live in a very busy neighborhood, on a very busy intersection. The move to this location has taken a toll on Zulu's mental wellbeing and her current humans would love to find a quiet, loving home for her to spend her golden years in! She is spayed and is current on her vaccines. 

Zulu is located in Tucson, Arizona. You may reach her owner at acespino888@gmail.com or (520)440-5575."

The man who had adopted her several years ago passed away and family members were unable to properly care for her. Samantha came to us infested with fleas, coat in terrible condition, large tumor on her shoulder, and very depressed. We treated the fleas, had the tumor removed (benign!), gave her great care so her coat grew back healthy, and helped her get her good spirits back. Happy and healthy now, she'd love to find a new home where she can relax and enjoy life. She's good with other dogs and a total sweetheart. Very calm and easy to have around, but plenty of spunk left too. Seniors are such great, grateful companions. Samantha deserves her happily-ever-after!

Breed: Labrador retriever
Age: Approx. 3 Years as of April 2019
Sex: Female
Good with Dogs: Yes
Good with Cats: Unknown, but can test for approved applicant upon request. Based on her temperament, we suspect she would be fine with kitties!
Good with Kids:  Yes
Heartworm Status:  Negative

Norah came to us with what we are guessing is her biological family member, Margo in mid-2018 from what was initially described to us as a hoarding case in Twiggs County. As we learned more about their origination, our hearts broke for these poor mama dogs. Because when they came to us, they did indeed have three puppies between them, all three of which were approximately 6 weeks old. Norah and Margo have been through a personal purgatory that if a person had gone through, they would be hailed as superheroes. They and 36 other dogs of similar breed and ages were on a property under what from all reports has been described as a den of horrors. None of them had any sort of medical care, all were living in pens outside with little to no shelter. Many had teeth rotten from a steady diet of white bread. Little to no human contact was given to any of them.

Despite all of this, they were the best moms to their puppies. The puppies grew up and have since found forever homes of their own where they are loved and cared for. Norah and Margo both have spent extra time with us learning about people, socializing with other dogs, and getting plenty of medical care and a steady diet of good food. They have both been so appreciative. Itâs truly been a wonder to see their personalities blossom! 

Norah is a flirt. She likes to give you a big puppy smile and dance away from you just out of reach when you go to tickle that little pointy face of hers. Her zoomies are the best; sheâs like a blonde tornado of glee. She likes treats and to dance with Margo. Sheâs a rough and tumble tomboy that likes laid-back personalities in her canine companions. She gets along great with our small dogs and plays in the yard with them every day. She does fine with other big dogs as long as they arenât overly dominant. Despite her horrific past, she has no problems with things like food or resource guarding. Sheâs a soft, gentle, big bottomed girl that is still learning about how nice it is to be part of a pack that includes people. She is not a fan of the camera shutter sound and pretends to be a walrus with big eyes when itâs around.

Norah is still learning the ropes of walking on a leash completely comfortably, and she is making good progress. Her ideal family would include someone that appreciates her courage and is willing to give her the patience and love she needs to bridge that last gap of going from rescue dog to full fledged, comfortable member of a family. It may take her a couple of meetings with her potential family to really get a good sense of her goofy personality; this will be determined by our manager on a case-by-case basis. Norah tips the scales at approximately 60 pounds.

Although our rescue dogs share a common bond with one another, no rescue story is the same (even when similar). Vetting costs vary depending on their health conditions. For us, it is never about the money. We are a non-profit. Thank you for your love and support! All of our dogs are fully vetted: up-to-date on annual shots, spayed/neutered and microchipped with a lifetime registration. We look forward to hearing from you!

Hello! My name is Hearth AKA Tyson. I am 7 years old and about 68 pounds. Don't let my age fool you I am an active guy! I LOVE walks on the beach and am learning that car rides can be kinda awesome. They say I'm a lab mix BUT I think there may be a shepherd in my family tree since I have this handsome fur. I was with my first family for a long time but they had to move and couldn't take me with them, so now I am hanging out with my foster Dad and learning lots of new and exciting things!! My foster Dad says I'm a pretty special guy. I am an expert level cuddler and love getting scritches and rubs! My favorite chew is this yak stick thingy. Yum! 

I would probably be best as an only dog or with a single calm, balanced doggie friend who could be my wingman if I get nervous.... but I am still not willing to share my nachos! Some things are sacred! Because I'm a big strong athletic guy (foster Dad says I'm just big boned) I need a human who has some experience and willingness to continue my training to help me be the best boy! 

Great Things about Tyson!
-Crate Trained
-House Trained
- Knows some obedience - sit, stay, down, paw, place, crate, heel
-LOVES people
-Been good with children I have met
- Affectionate
- Active but not high energy
- Loves chew toys
- Learning to like toys, especially this one that looks a little like p-o-o-p ;)

OPH provides pet adoption services to families located in VA, DC, MD, PA and neighboring states. OPH is a 501(c)(3) organization and is 100% donor funded. OPH does not operate a shelter or have a physical location. We rely on foster families who open their homes to give love and attention to each dog before finding a forever home."

Adoption donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog).

Adoption donations are accepted via cash or debit/credit card. There is a $5 fee to run a card.

Please remember to bring a collar and leash with you the day of the adoption. 

Fill out an application online prior to arriving to our adoption event. This greatly speeds up the adoption process and will ensure that the animal you are interested in will be at the event. Not all adoptable dogs can make it to all events, because they are cared for in foster homes.

She is about 8 lbs, and is looking for a forever family who will not abandon her anymore. 

In a very remote part of southeast part of Korea, Jenny was found on the street abandoned by her human family.  We do not know how long she has been living on the street, but she was very thin, and also tested positive for heartworm.  She was relocated to a near by shelter, but we had to rescue her out when it was time for her to be euthanized to a nice foster home who was willing to take her in while she was being treated for HW,  Her personality was really blossoming while she was with the foster family, and we realized she is just another loving pup who likes to be petted, loves going for a walk, and plays with her toys.  She also loves people, and furry friends at the foster home.  We were told she is not much of a barker, which would make her a perfect city dog where she can live in an apartment, and gets to go to a nearby dog park to play with other dogs!  Now, she has to take is the monthly HW meds just like any other dogs, but other than that, she received thumbs up from the vet, and she is ready for his forever home!

We believe people who adopt rescue animals because they are willing to accept a bit of imperfection, and willing to embrace, work/ train and love them no matter what baggage the animal had in the past. It can be challenging, but extremely rewarding. We have seen amazing transformation in our adopted dogs who have been with loving families, and it is our goal to provide all of them with the opportunity. We are at our happiest when we see photos of our adopted animals smile with the new adoptive family, and we hope to find Jenny a loving family who would do the same.

He loves people, and loves getting petted.  He does not like it when other dogs try to take the attention away while he is sitting on your lap, and would growl, but he never attacks.  He is relatively very calm, and not hyper.  He plays well with other calm dogs but stays away from dogs that are more jumpy.  When he was rescued, he tested positive for heartworm, but he has been treated for HW since then.

2-3 year old Male beagle about 15lbs. Was found in a southern Virginia shelter by a volunteer. 

This dog tested positive for Ehrlichia before arriving to the rescue. Ehrlichia is a very common type of bacteria that infects dogs and other species and is spread by ticks. Ehrlichia is not contagious to humans or other pets. The only way to get this disease is to be bitten by a tick that carries it. The treatment is typically 21-30 days of antibiotics. This dog started treatment upon arriving to the rescue. 

**I will be at the Richmond Dog Festival Event in Richmond, VA on 9/21/19 from 11am to 4pm at Chimborazo Park 3215 E. Broad St. Richmond, VA 23223 . I would love to meet my furever family so come by and meet me this weekend !

Adoption donations are $250 for an aduult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). All dogs are spay/neutered, have rabies, distemper vaccine, microchip, heartworm test if age appropriate, and are current on heartworm preventative. Adoption donations are accepted via cash or debit/credit card. There is a $5 fee to run a card.

Please remember to bring a collar and leash with you the day of the adoption. 

Fill out an application online prior to arriving to our adoption event. This greatly speeds up the adoption process and will ensure that the animal you are interested in will be at the event. Not all adoptable dogs can make it to all events, because they are cared for in foster homes. Our adoption events are most Wednesdayâs from 5-7pm and each Saturday from Noon until 4 PM on Saturdayâs at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. There are circumstances that we will not have an adoption event, so please email or check our Facebook prior to coming to ensure we will be open. 

We do receive HUNDREDS of emails daily. The fastest way to get a response is to fill out an application on our website, NOT by submitting an inquiry. Online applications get priority over applications filled out in person.

Hello! My name is Brioni and I joined my new foster family, after my trip up with the designer dogs, this weekend. My foster mom calls me a mini St. Bernard (they say St. Bernard/hound mix), she says I look a bit like one but I'm pretty small, around 25 pounds. 

I am still adjusting to all of the changing things around me. I am walking up and down stairs for the first time, I am also learning how to walk on a leash, I take a lot of cues from my foster sister. So far I have liked meeting new dogs and people. Right now, my favorite thing is to nap on the couch. Every day I am learning new things so come back and check on my progress.

I am hoping to find a forever home where I can cuddle and play and learn, is that with you? If so apply today! I wont be available long!

 Diane von Furstenberg is a beagle mix girls who is about 5 years old and 27 lbs. Just look at those melting chocolate eyes and smooth long ears - talk about easy on the eyes. 

Diane, who is is fondly called Jolene by her foster family, is a pretty low-key dog. She is timid around new people and will need an adopter who understands that she's going to take some time to warm up. This is all so new to her, and we don't know her background, so perhaps she hasn't had a loving home before. She is very playful with the other dog in her foster home, and this is when we see her fun, quirky side come out. Her foster family is working on slowly socializing her, and helping her to build confidence so her true personality can shine. She is working on her house-training, and does well in a crate - no accidents there, and she is a quiet sleeper. And she walks well on a leash. She is just the sweetest little thing, and we will update her profile as she comes out of her shell more.

This dog tested positive for Ehrlichia and Anaplasmosis before arriving to the rescue. These are very common type of bacteria that infects dogs and other species and is spread by ticks. Neither is contagious to humans or other pets. The only way to get either is to be bitten by a tick that carries it. The treatment is typically 21-30 days of antibiotics. This dog started treatment upon arriving to the rescue.

We are Hoss and Abbigale and we come as a pair of cuties! Together we weigh about 15 pounds, and around 6 years old. We do everything together like sit on your lap and sleep in our kennel. We do fine with other dogs, but we are not really interested in playing with them. We sleep quietly in our kennel and have had no accidents in there. The shelter environment and our foster home is new to us so we are a little timid. It took us a few hours before we warmed up to our foster family. For the most part we do a good job of using puppy pads. I Hoss (white and brown) do a good job on going outside on a leash, Abbigale (brown) prefers not to go outside. We would be best with older children (10+) as we are small and timid. It is also good to know that I (Hoss) have a pin in one of my front legs. It does not prevent me from running/jumping or having fun. We are both sweet and cuddly, we just need a family to call our own. We hope you will come and meet us on Saturday!

Adoption donations are $250 for an adult, $350 for puppies (a dog under one year of age), and $125 for a senior dog (based on the age of the dog). All dogs are spay/neutered, have rabies, distemper vaccine, microchip, heartworm test if age appropriate, and are current on heartworm preventative. Adoption donations are accepted via cash or debit/credit card. There is a $5 fee to run a card.

Please remember to bring a collar and leash with you the day of the adoption. 

Fill out an application online prior to arriving to our adoption event. This greatly speeds up the adoption process and will ensure that the animal you are interested in will be at the event. Not all adoptable dogs can make it to all events, because they are cared for in foster homes. Our adoption events are most Wednesdayâs from 5-7pm and each Saturday from Noon until 4 PM on Saturdayâs at 3602 Lafayette Blvd, Suite 102, Fredericksburg, VA 22408. There are circumstances that we will not have an adoption event, so please email or check our Facebook prior to coming to ensure we will be open. 

We do receive HUNDREDS of emails daily. The fastest way to get a response is to fill out an application on our website, NOT by submitting an inquiry. Online applications get priority over applications filled out in person.

Iâm Reagan. I used to live my life on a chain and could never go in the house. I've had a lot of litters of puppies in my day. I was recently seized from a house by these nice animal control officers. They found out that I was heartworm positive and I also need a dental cleaning. But now I love the air conditioning and don't want to stay outside longer than I have to go to the bathroom. Which I normally do outside! I'm sweet as can be and I love cats and children. I walked a little bow-legged and would really benefit from joint supplements. Belly rubs are my favorite!

Note: I am heartworm positive because I never got the preventative in my prior home.  Iâll be treated and then Iâll just need 30 days of low activity to heal.

Iâm loving my life in my foster home right now! I get free range of the house because I seem to be fully house trained and I crate well when told to! I know basic commands like sit, down, and shake with both my paws. My favorite activity is laying in bed with my foster mom cause I love to snuggle so much! I also double as her body guard. I might be 9 y/o but that doesnât slow my long legs down when my foster family goes out to do activities. When you come to meet me ignore how shy I might seem because when you get me home I will be the most bestest doggo ever! 

Note:  In my prior home I didn't like it when people would \""play fight\"" because that upset me and made me bite.  If I felt like someone was being hurt, I was going to protect that person.  So if you can work with me on this, I will be pretty easy to get along with otherwise.

Hi! My name is Vera Wang and Im part of the Designer Dog transport. Im guessed to be a Weimaraner mix (maybe some hound?), around 1 1/2 years old and weigh about 30 lbs. I am still a youngster and have a good amount of typical puppy tendencies in me....

I like to zoom around the yard (as you can see by clicking here). I love exploring all the smells, some play biting and I sometimes jump up to get to the things I want. We can work on correcting these together! My foster Mom says I take correction very well. I am happy girl who likes being on the move and have enjoyed the walks Ive taken.....I would be a great running partner after I am trained to do so.

I just arrived a couple days ago so my foster Mom is just starting to learn about me....so far in my foster home...
*I have loved meeting new people....men and women....I havent met any kids yet
*I love being with my people better than the crate so it sometimes takes me a while to settle
*I have liked all the dogs Ive met.....and Ive had 2 play dates that went great!
*My foster mom is working with me on potty training...too soon to tell what I know...
*Ive had no accidents in the crate and can last through the night.

Do I sound like your match? If so, apply today! I wont be available long!

Minnie is a precious little gal who was born sometime around the first of the year. She came to us with her littermate, Mickey, from a home in southern VA where neither was given any human handling or socialization. Although both are very sweet, they are skittish and each will need a home with a patient owner able to provide a consistent schedule and lots of human interaction. We expect Minnie to be less than 10 pounds when fully grown.

Minnie is in good health. She has had her puppy vaccines and will be spayed and microchipped as a part of our adoption process.

CARE Rescue is  foster-base rescue located in Richmond, VA.  We do not have a facility for you to come to meet animals at.  You must visit our weekly adoption stand (calendar on our website) to meet the adoptable dogs.

She and her sibling Lucy (who was happily adopted in VA) were both rescue from a temple in the remote southeast part of Korea. Their mother, Star, who is a small Maltese belonging to a man who works at the temple, was raised as an outdoor dog, tied up to a post. In Korea, the winter weather is very harsh, and they get a lot of snow, and we have no idea how a little Maltese survived all those years! The man decided to give up these two pups, since they have no place for growing family, and after much resistance from the man, we were finally able to convince him to also surrender Star to us. Star will also be joining us soon here and hope to be reunited with her babies!

Lulu is such a friendly pup, and plays well with other dogs and people. She is very loving and sweet, and weighs around 9 lbs currently. We believe she will be under 15 lbs even as a full grown. She loves playtime, treat time, kiss time, naptime, and did I mention playtime and kiss time?? She is a perfect small terrier who is fun and friendly, but because she is mixed breed, not designer breed dogs, she has a zero chance to be adopted in Korea. Since she was with our foster's family, we are happy to report Lulu has mastered the potty training, and she is on target 95% currently. We would love to provide a family who already have a small furry friend in their because Lulu likes to play with other dogs. Other than that, she received a clean bill of health from the vet, and she is ready to be adopted! 

We believe people who adopt rescue animals because they are willing to accept a bit of imperfection, and willing to embrace, work/ train and love them no matter what baggage the animal had in the past. It can be challenging, but extremely rewarding. We have seen amazing transformation in our adopted dogs who have been with loving families, and it is our goal to provide all of them with the opportunity. We are at our happiest when we see photos of our adopted animals smile with the new adoptive family, and we hope to find Lulu a loving family who would do the same. 

Please consider adopting Lulu and making her part of your family! If you would like to apply to adopt Lulu, you can download an application here:

Let me tell you a bit about me... I'm living in a foster home now with three other dogs and no kids or cats. I get along fairly well with the other canines, but they have been correcting me a bit lately (something about etiquette and personal space). I am a young and playful small dog with not too many cares in the world. I'm working on the potty training currently, but  the puppy pads are working great for me. I haven't done a lot of leash walking yet, I'm not super fond of it. I can get a bit persistent and riled up at times, I slept in the crate last night and although it's not my favorite place to be, I settle down after a bit. I have only been here for about a week and I am learning new dog skills every day. Its not that I don't like it here, but am looking for my forever family, a place to call home permanently! Ask about me or fill out the application! I am about a year old and 8lbs.

I'm Dorian's Princess! OPH helped evacuate me from a partner shelter in Hurricane Dorian's path. I was worried, but now I'm safe with OPH and looking for a home! 

I've been with my foster family a week now and here are some things they think you should know about me:
~ I'm a female pup, about 5 months old and 38 pounds. I am small though, my foster mom was surprised at the vet at my weight.
~My foster family believes that I am a Lab mix pup. I LOVE the water, just like most labs do. 
~I'm a happy girl, my tail is always wagging, and I have loved everyone with 2 and 4 legs that I have met. 
~ I am quiet in my crate.
~ I appear to be house trained (no accidents yet but I may need a day to adjust to your home don't forget)
~ My foster mom believes you should feed me in my crate for a while yet so I can better learn to trust everyone. I may have missed a few meals before in my short life so I gobble my food down. When the door is closed and I feel safe I eat at a much more normal speed.
~ I went to a super fun party in Arlington over the weekend (It was an adoption event my foster mom says) and I did great even with the hussle of the city and lots, and lots of new people.


For now, here are some tidbits about me:
~ I'm super friendly with everyone
~ I'm super quiet in my crate
~ I'm keeping my crate nice and clean. This makes Foster momma very happy.
~ I'm learning to play with toys.
~ I'm doing great with leash walking
~ I'm going to win a contest for the longest tail Foster mom says. It's almost as long as I am tall! She says it's adorable since it's always moving.
~ I'm ready to find my forever family.

A pretty girl like me should have all the petting, don't you think so? Hi, I'm Dorian's Penny. I was evacuated from a shelter in NC that was projected to be in Hurricane Dorian's path. I am about 3 years old and weigh about 45lbs. I could be part collie part hound mix. 

My foster Momma says at her house:
- I'm good in a crate, just need a little more time practicing the going in part.
- So far I haven't had any accidents.
- I am a bit timid, but I am working on learning trust. I now happy prance when foster Momma takes me outside instead of Pancaking myself to the ground. 
- I love my foster brother Dorian's Paxton. He is helping me come out of my she'll more everyday. 

Foster Momma doesn't know what happened to me before I got to the shelter. I can't tell her but she says she doesn't think I've had an easy life. Don't worry she is helping mend my heart with love. I went to the dog park and tried to make some friends today (9.15.19), I sniffed and trotted with some dogs. My favorite part was there were so many new people to pet me! If you are interested in me, please apply today. I am looking for a family to call my own. 

This dog tested positive for Ehrlichia before arriving to the rescue. Ehrlichia is a very common type of bacteria that infects dogs and other species and is spread by ticks. Ehrlichia is not contagious to humans or other pets. The only way to get this disease is to be bitten by a tick that carries it. The treatment is typically 21-30 days of antibiotics. This dog started treatment upon arriving to the rescue.

Hi, I'm Dorian's Buttercup! OPH helped evacuate me from a partner shelter in Hurricane Dorian's path and now I'm safe with OPH and looking for a home! 

I'm a female pup, about 6 months old, 38 pounds and appear to be perhaps a Hound/Shepherd mix. My family says I am the PERFECT size since I sit right in the middle of my small and larger siblings.

My three favorite things so far since coming to my foster family have been belly rubs, squeaky toys and the abundance of other dogs to befriend. I am very good with getting to know other dogs and making sure we are on the same page and boy do I love to play if they let me! I have been around large dogs and small and just love them all. If I feel overwhelmed in any way I lay down and let them sniff me but I do not react as I know they are just getting to know me too! 

I have been practicing walking on the leash and with the guidance of some of my foster siblings I am picking it up quickly!! I really enjoy walking and sniffing all around these new place. I would absolutely LOVE to find a forever family that loves walking as much as me. Did I mention I LOVE belly rubs too? My foster family says I am all about the \""people loving\"" and the cuddles, which I why I think I get SO many kisses from them!!

I have been given so many gold stars for my potty training skills since coming in to my foster home! I much prefer to do my business outside, which to my surprise I have been given lots of yummy treats for, so I think I will keep that up!! 

I do very well in my crate and understand it is my safe place for me to relax. I sleep well through the night and when my foster family is out of the house I stay in my crate just fine. 

**The only BIG thing missing in my world right now, is a family to call my own. I really would LOVE to find a human family of any size who would let me make them as happy as they would make me!!**

I'm Dorian's Lightning! OPH helped evacuate me from a partner shelter in Hurricane Dorian's path. I was worried, but now I'm safe with OPH and looking for a home! 

I'm a male pup, about 5 months old and 30 pounds. I appear to be a Lab mix. 

Lightning is settling well. He is a very active dog and is getting along with the foster's other dogs very well. Overall a very sweet pup, smart and learns fast. He wants a lot of attention, and toys. He loves to give plenty of kisses, and cuddle. His cuddles dont last long because he is always moving. 

He is doing really well with crate training. He will cry for the first 5-10 minutes of being in the crate, but he will calm down. 

We are working on housetraining. He needs to be let out often because he is still young, but we have not had any issues with him peeing or pooping in the house. 

He is very friendly and follows me everywhere. 

He does okay on a leash and we are working on it.

Hi! Im Milky! I am one year old and weigh about 33 lbs. I am a \""Desi Dog\"" (a local term for \""street dog\"") from India in search of a home of my own. My sister Peppy Desi Dog and I are the only surviving puppies of a litter of five born on the street in New Delhi. I had a hard first year of life. I was hit by a car and had a broken leg, but I was rescued by KAW, a local animal welfare group, who nursed me back to good health. Now I am in search of a forever home!

I made my trip to the USA just in time for my birthday! I'm a year old September 10, 2019. I have adjusted incredibly well already. I'm so happy to be here and I LOVE my new squeaky toys. Guess what??? I like playing with the garden hose, as you can see by clicking here.

I'm working on my house training. My foster mom says it won't take me long because I'm a smart girl. 

Please take me home and show me my new life!

Iâm a spunky little snuggle bug looking for my forever people. I love playing with other dogs but if you donât have another dog for me to play with, thatâs fine too because I just want to be your very best friend! I love being around my people and will follow you wherever you go! Whether thatâs on a walk or just hanging out on the couch, I just want to keep you company! 
I appear house and crate trained and have had ZERO accidents in my foster home! I also sleep quietly in my crate at night. Sometimes I bark for a minute or two when I first go into my crate but I settle down quickly if you just leave me be. 
Iâm very food motivated which means I can learn new things pretty quickly as long as youâre offering a treat! So far Iâve mastered âsitâ and âdownâ! My foster parents say Iâm pretty smart!
If you have room in your life for a fun little adventure buddy, Iâd love to meet you!

Note:  I am heartworm positive, so that means I need to have low activity until my treatment and 30 days of low activity after my treatment.  I can still be adopted though!

Note: I do have a condition called âcherry eyeâ. Cherry eye is a disorder of the nictitating membrane (NM), also called the third eyelid. Cherry eye is most often seen in young dogs under the age of two. In many species, the third eyelid plays an essential role in vision by supplying oxygen and nutrients to the eye via tear production. If left untreated, tear production may stop. This can be treated with a simple surgery.  She's getting that surgery on 9/17 along with her spay as well.

Hi there! My name is Chloie and I LOVE to run-run-run at full speed around my fenced-in yard, chase tennis balls, then curl up and be a couch potato. Makes sense since I am three years young. Im a beautiful shepherd mix and 57 pounds. My four puppies were adopted, so I am now looking for my very own forever home. Maybe its with you?

My foster mom says I am a good girl. I love to play with my toys and with my foster mom's personal dog. I love walks. I can be your walking buddy. My foster mom says I prance and jump like a deer. She says she loves everything about me. I may bark when in a new environment or if I know youre making my dinner -- because I'm excited and hungry -- but other than that, Im usually a quiet girl. I do best with slow introductions to other dogs and strangers. I would flourish with an experienced or patient dog owner who can continue to help me learn commands.

I have a guardian angel that thinks I am very special and has sponsored me.

Im just a real sweetheart who wants to love and be loved. Come meet me!

Hi! My name is Weston, Im guessed to be a one-year-old yellow lab mix, and Im 100% goof ball! I'm a big boy, currently weighing about 70lbs, but I can still be a lap dog! I dont mind being in my crate, but sometimes I dont want to go inside, but some encouragement helps. I go potty outside most of the time and, so far, Ive only had one accident in my fosters home. Im quiet most of the time, except when I hear other dogs barking. I cant help but answer back just to say hi! I LOVE walks and sometimes I get very excited on my walks and pull ahead of my foster hooman, but Im working on my leash manners. Its just that I like to sniff and explore everything and get excited and forget my foster hooman is behind me.

Im smart and energetic, and sometimes my excited energy takes over and I jump up on people or things, but my foster hooman is helping me work on my manners. She says Im a quick learner, especially if treats are involved! Ive even learned to sit when asked, and Im willing to try and learn anything. So far, Ive been good with most dogs, Ive ignored things called chickens while I was on a leash, but I barked at this big thing my foster hooman called a horse. What was that thing?! Everything is so new to me since Ive been out of the shelter, but Im learning!

Im in search of my furever home. Is that with you? If so apply today! I won't be available for long! I cant wait!!!!!!

You wont find a more devoted heart than Daisy's. She is an affectionate, sweet, loving girl who can be a little on the shy side. Once she knows you, though, you are friends for life. Daisy is looking for someone who wants a best, best, best friend. After a rough start in life, she has come such a long way and is looking for a patient person to give her the life she deserves. 

Daisy is about five years young, with a playful spirit and a happy smile. In her current foster home, she is crate trained and housebroken. She enjoys chew toys but is good about not chewing the things she shouldnt. She loves to go for walks and is learning simple commands like 'sit.' Sometimes when her favorite people come home, she is so happy she has the 'zoomies'! She has deep, thoughtful eyes and weighs about 50 pounds. She does great in a fenced yard and enjoys being outdoors.

Looking for a best four legged friend and faithful companion? Then meet Chubbers, the Corgi/Chihuahua mix! Hes about 6 years old and only 15 pounds so he is very portable and can go most anywhere with you. This shy guy came to OPH on 7/3/19 after some time at an overcrowded shelter in VA, where he was scared, but willing to be handled and enjoyed the attention he received from his OPH rescuer. Chubbers is doing really well in his foster home. He has peacefully coexisted with the dogs he has met so far in his foster home. He likes walks and sure enjoys just hanging with his people. He needs slow introductions to new people to allow him to properly get to know visitors and greet them nicely. His foster says he has nice house manners. Does he sound like the perfect pup for you? If so, please apply to adopt this sweet boy today!

\""Under your scars I pray you're like a shooting star in the rain. You're everything that feels like home to me.\"" From the song \""Scars\"" by Godsmack

We all have scars, some just can't be seen. While Fritos has some scars of a possible rough life, she lives up to her original name of Sunshine. 

Are you looking for a dog who: 
* Will love you unconditionally until the very end? 
* Loves to be outside playing ball, going for walks, car rides, maybe runs or possibly a frisbee partner? 
* Will keep your yard critter free? 
* Comes pre-loaded with a billion kisses? 
* Is pre-trained for belly rubs? 
* Enjoys learning new tricks? 
* Can be self-entertained with toys and bones? 
* Is already house and crate trained?

If so, then I am the PERFECT girl for you!!! If you want to take me to training, that would be fantastic! After a proper introduction, I'm doing fantastic with the 3 other dogs in my foster home (see pictures and video). I love being loved on, petted and receive ear scratches. I am willing to please in exchange for a loving home. Will that be with you? Come on, let's love life together scars and all!

Hi! My name is Bela! I'm a HOUSETRAINED female boxer mix, around 3 years old, and weight about 50lbs. I'm playful, affectionate, and crate trained. I love to cuddle on your lap and play with my toys. I get along great with my home companions including Patch, another foster dog you can find right here on this website! I do need a slow introduction to new dogs and people. I cannot live in a home with cats. While outside I'm usually quiet unless I see the neighbors and want to say hi! I respect my fence and can be left alone, loose in my foster's house with no worries! Meeting new people and other animals makes me get scared so I should be crated (which I go into very nicely) before visitors arrive. My foster mommy says I'm an easy and great dog to have in the family. If you are looking for a new friend like me please apply to adopt me. I've been looking for my forever family. Could it be you?

Say hello to Mia, a nine-month-old, 30-pound female Desi dog (a local term for street dog) from India. Mia has quite a rescue story her mom, Furry, was living on the streets of New Delhi with Mia and her three siblings when they were very young, but their mother was unable to feed them due to illness. Mom and pups were taken into Kannan Animal Welfare, a rescue group in New Delhi, and brought back to health. Furry has already been adopted here in the US, and now Mia is the first of her puppies to come in search of a home! 

Because Mia grew up in a rescue facility, life in a home is very new for her. That being said, theres plenty about it she loves! Walks, couches, grassy open spaces, and toys (even sticks will do!), have all been big hits. When Mia is comfortable she is a funny, happy, and athletic girl whos happy to spend a few minutes wrestling or racing with the other dogs in her foster home, and then a few more minutes snuggling with her foster mom. 

Mia thrives on routine and attaches very deeply to her household members. Although she would benefit from ongoing exposure to new situations and people, she would probably be happiest in a low-key household with one or two people, who can help her develop a sense of security and confidence. Those people will find in Mia a dog who is endlessly entertaining, unbelievably charming, and absolutely devoted!

Are you looking for a dog who loves the outdoors as much as you do? Someone to walk and hike with, or just to sit on a bench and watch the world go by? If so, beautiful tri-colored Aubin (aka Luna) would like to be your companion! Aubin is a 4 year old lab/beagle mix, about 52 lb, knows basic commands, and is housebroken.

Getting to know other dogs could be exhausting and stressful, and Aubin would love to have humans who understand that. 

Aubin is very sweet and affectionate. She will happily let you pet her all day long. She thinks she is a lap dog. She will look up at you when you pet her, as if to say, \""Hey, thanks, that feels good!\"" Aubin has been reported great walking on the leash, and an excellent car passenger. 

Does this girl check all of the boxes for you? If so, she would be a great match for you - apply to meet this beauty today!

Im Bowie! I am estimated to be a 6-year-old Catahoula Leopard Dog mix. Im a big boy, weighing about 75 lbs and I came to OPH from South Carolina, so Im a southern gentleman. Howdy-do!

My foster mom thinks Im awesome! She says Im crate-trained, I havent had a single accident in my foster home, and I only bark when the other dogs in my foster home bark to welcome someone home. I sometimes talk and sing when my food is being prepared, because I love mealtime! I also get very excited about going out and I spring about 3 feet straight up off the ground when its time to go! I am a strong boy, so I get walked on an easy-walk harness, which works well for me. My foster mom says Im smart to avoid obstacles and not get my leash tangled around them. Yay, me!

I am a people dog, so I love to be with my foster family and getting attention. I can get nervous and anxious around other dogs, so I would probably do best in a home as an only dog, but I think I would do well in almost any environment: apartment, townhouse, single-family home. As long as I can be part of the family and show my devotion, I will be a happy boy.

Flannery is 2 years old and weighs about 30 lbs with a look and a personality like a min-pin. She is an energetic, busy girl who LOVES to go for lots of walks and would likely even be a nice running buddy. She is smart and curious and will thrive on challenges. She just completed an Intro to Agility class and was a SUPERSTAR! With more training, she could be a serious competitor. She has mastered the tunnel, A-frame, hoop, and can jump anything you put in front of her. She has also been introduced to the teeter and the dog walk. Flannery will fetch anything - balls, frisbees, toys, even rocks!

Her funny personality, keeps us all chuckling. She loves to play with toys and when no one is available to play with, she will just toss toys to herself! Flannery is also a first-class snuggler and a Phillies fan.

Like her namesake, Flannery is a spunky southern girl. She will need an adopter who has some dog experience. That steller brain of hers could easily take over the show. She will do best in a home without children, while she adores children, she has a tendency to nip grabby hands. She gets along fine with other dogs, does fine with cats, has great recall off-leash, and is housebroken and crate-trained. She is smart, willing, intense, athletic, and speedy. While Flannery can be a quirky dog, she is also a sweetheart who will keep you entertained and adored for years to come. Looking for a best, best, best friend? Look no further.

Since Im about 1 year young, at that young age, we do have a lot of energy but that will likely taper off as I get older. I am a hound/boxer mix. Im a sweet girl weighing in currently at 51lbs. 

Im house broken and I know basic commands like sit and wait, I also do really well in my crate when no one is home.. I play great with other doggy friends but would probably do best in a home without feline companions or kids under 12 as I can be overwhelming and dont really understand boundaries.

Do you go for lots of trips or want a dog to take everywhere with you? Great news, Im the dog for you! I love car rides!I play great at the dog park and love to get out there and run around. I would prefer to go to a home without small children as I can get overwhelmed by them. Please dont let that deter you though, I really am a sweet, amazing girl!

Hi! My name is Weston, Im guessed to be a one-year-old yellow lab mix, and Im 100% goof ball! I'm a big boy, currently weighing about 70lbs, but I can still be a lap dog! I dont mind being in my crate, but sometimes I dont want to go inside, but some encouragement helps. I go potty outside most of the time and, so far, Ive only had one accident in my fosters home. Im quiet most of the time, except when I hear other dogs barking. I cant help but answer back just to say hi! I LOVE walks and sometimes I get very excited on my walks and pull ahead of my foster hooman, but Im working on my leash manners. Its just that I like to sniff and explore everything and get excited and forget my foster hooman is behind me.

Im smart and energetic, and sometimes my excited energy takes over and I jump up on people or things, but my foster hooman is helping me work on my manners. She says Im a quick learner, especially if treats are involved! Ive even learned to sit when asked, and Im willing to try and learn anything. So far, Ive been good with most dogs, Ive ignored things called chickens while I was on a leash, but I barked at this big thing my foster hooman called a horse. What was that thing?! Everything is so new to me since Ive been out of the shelter, but Im learning!

Im in search of my furever home. Is that with you? If so apply today! I won't be available for long! I cant wait!!!!!!

My name is Kalei! I am a super-social, adorable 3-year old Labrador/Terrier mix and weigh an athletic 45 lbs. 

I have a guardian angel that thinks I am very special and has sponsored me. 

I love to make friends with humans and dogs everywhere I go. Ive been around kids and cats at the dog sitters house and I like them too. I love to go for walks and run, and Im also happy to do yoga with you or coach you through your workout. I know how to snuggle and relax too! If invited, I will curl up with you at night and while watching TV, but I dont usually get on furniture on my own. 

I am a great model! I would love my own Instagram. I happily wear clothes and I love toys. My foster says I have personality for days and I will steal your soul with her eyes! 
I check all the boxes, but need one accommodation. I cannot be crated. I am doing really well in a home with a fenced back yard and doggie door, and am looking for a home with those features so I can let myself out to go potty when youre not home. 

I am spayed and have had my vaccinations and preventatives! Apply to adopt me today!

Hi, my name is Harry Pawter! Im part of the Punny Names transport that came to OPH on 7/26/19. I am about 1 or 2 years old and I currently weigh 15 pounds. I am thought to be a Chihuahua mix with possibly some Beagle.

I am a timid dog, but I am very loving. My favorite things to do are snuggle on the couch and play in the yard. I also enjoy playing with other dogs as long as they dont play too rough. Ideally, I would like a home where I will be treated gently with lots of love.

I know some basic manners, but I still have a lot to learn. I am still working on potty training, but Im learning fast. At my foster home, I dont bark or jump often unless I get really excited.

I get scared when I hear loud sounds or see fast movements, but it will just take some time for me to get used to these things in a new home. A little reassurance is something Ill need from my new family members to help me get comfortable. I know the right family will come along and give me the love and patience I need!

I am currently living in a foster home in King William, VA. Please visit me if youre interested in adopting!

Hi! My name is Titanic and Im part of the Blockbuster Movie transport that arrived to OPH 8-9-19

My foster mom calls me Ginger, Im guessed to be a Chi-weenie Mix and estimated to be about 2 years old. Im a sweet girl and I currently weigh about 15 lbs.
Im mostly housetrained, but I still have accidents in the house if I dont have a pad to go on. I get scared when it rains or storms and I just cant help myself, but foster mom is working with me to get over my fears and stop having accidents.

I am crate trained! In fact I love my crate! I only bark in the crate after I hear the humans are awake in the morning and Im ready for my breakfast.
I LOVE to snuggle with my humans, nothing is better than a human lap to lay on and get infinite pets.
I also love to play with my foster sibling Zoya. I dont play with other dogs in the dog park yet, just my sister, but she is showing me that other dogs can be fun too. Shes so outgoing and playful with the other dogs, I hope I can be like her one day but right now Im just not so sure about all these other dogs. Im okay with them sniffing me but Im not quite ready to play with dogs I dont know well.

I walk really well on a leash, and Im so good at recall that my foster mom sometimes drops my leash and lets me walk freely and I stay near her all the time and always come running when she calls me.

If you are looking for a cute sweet little dog that will love you more than anything and sit on your lap all day long Im the girl for you!!!

Hi! My name is Patch and I'm a beautiful 10 month old female Lab Mix. I currently weight about 50lbs. My foster mommy believes I may be HOUSETRAINED! I'm very affectionate and playful.
I have a shiny black coat and pretty face. I like playing with my stuffed toys, running around in the yard, or just laying under a tree chewing on a bone. My energy level may be just what you need for a running buddy! I don't jump up on people and try very hard to do what I'm told. I'm well behaved in my yard and house as long as I am supervised. I'm doing very well responding to verbal commands. I've learned how to use my underground electric fence as well as learning to respect the above ground fence. Everyday I'm getting better with house manners and respecting my doggy playmates. I play very well with my fostered buddy Bela, who you can find on this website! At my first adoption event I was very well behaved while meeting new people and dogs. I played very nicely with large dogs and a very small dog while supervised.

I hope to find my forever family soon. Could that be you?

This dog tested positive for Lyme before arriving to the rescue. Lymes is a very common type of bacteria that infects dogs and other species and is spread by ticks. Lymes is not contagious to humans or other pets. The only way to get this disease is to be bitten by a tick that carries it. The treatment is typically 21-30 days of antibiotics. This dog started treatment upon arriving to the rescue.

You wont find a more devoted heart than Daisy's. She is an affectionate, sweet, loving girl who can be a little on the shy side. Once she knows you, though, you are friends for life. Daisy is looking for someone who wants a best, best, best friend. After a rough start in life, she has come such a long way and is looking for a patient person to give her the life she deserves. 

Daisy is about five years young, with a playful spirit and a happy smile. In her current foster home, she is crate trained and housebroken. She enjoys chew toys but is good about not chewing the things she shouldnt. She loves to go for walks and is learning simple commands like 'sit.' Sometimes when her favorite people come home, she is so happy she has the 'zoomies'! She has deep, thoughtful eyes and weighs about 50 pounds. She does great in a fenced yard and enjoys being outdoors.

Im Bowie! I am estimated to be a 6-year-old Catahoula Leopard Dog mix. Im a big boy, weighing about 75 lbs and I came to OPH from South Carolina, so Im a southern gentleman. Howdy-do!

My foster mom thinks Im awesome! She says Im crate-trained, I havent had a single accident in my foster home, and I only bark when the other dogs in my foster home bark to welcome someone home. I sometimes talk and sing when my food is being prepared, because I love mealtime! I also get very excited about going out and I spring about 3 feet straight up off the ground when its time to go! I am a strong boy, so I get walked on an easy-walk harness, which works well for me. My foster mom says Im smart to avoid obstacles and not get my leash tangled around them. Yay, me!

I am a people dog, so I love to be with my foster family and getting attention. I can get nervous and anxious around other dogs, so I would probably do best in a home as an only dog, but I think I would do well in almost any environment: apartment, townhouse, single-family home. As long as I can be part of the family and show my devotion, I will be a happy boy.

With monthly preventatives, the disease is completely preventable.

Look into my eyes....you will be hypnotized by my charm!

Hello, my name is Zekke! I am six months old and estimated to be a husky mix. I arrived at my foster familys house after a super fun flight all the way from NC. Have you been on a plane ride? It was sure fun.

I've been hanging out with my foster family for a few weeks now and while its fun here, I would sure like to find my forever family as well. Below are some fun things my family wants you to know about me.

- I am crate trained. Im quiet in my crate and sleep the night away and know to keep it nice and tidy with my toys. Can't ask for more than that can you?
- I have kept my crate clean and dry. (If I bark in my crate its because I have to go out)
- I appear to be housebroken but foster Mom says accidents can happen in a new environment. Don't worry, we will both be learning when I come home with you but we will both quickly know how to talk to each other. 
- Ive just about mastered this whole leash walking thing. It was brand new to me when I arrived but I like to take walks so I'm learning how to walk like a good boy mom says. I still get excited sometimes and get tangled in foster mom's legs but we are working through it.
- Im learning other fun things too. I LOVE treats so teaching me things is pretty easy. Ive mastered sit & lay down and am trying REALLY HARD on stay (that one is tough, I like to be with mom when we are outside (she hides cookies in her pockets for me, how can I resist that)) 
 - I appear to be a roll with the punches type of pup. Ive liked everyone, 2 and 4 legged that Ive met so far. 
- Foster Mom says I am one of the easiest fosters they have had. I am quiet, keep the place clean and follow the rules. I think she likes me. :)
- I would do best in a home with older kids (over 12) until I settle down a bit more. Im pretty mouthy still, just like most teenagers. I am working on keeping this under control and am getting better each day. These foster family people don't take any back talk from me about this, they are tough. Mom says my forever people will have to continue to be tough and remind me about this until I fully outgrow it.
- I would be a great hiking or running partner with a little training. Mom & I are doing a bit of running and I LOVE IT! The foster kids started school so we have been super busy and unable to hike but we have talked about it and I'm pretty sure I would like that as well. I love to be busy.
- TOYS! I have discovered TOYS and love them. I am getting pretty good with fetch (I will bring the ball back most of the time, sometimes I get distracted) and love soft toys that make noise. Foster mom told me not to destroy them and I'm doing really good with it. I really am enjoying the toy box here. I like to take one outside each time we go. Silly foster mom picks them all up and brings back inside at bedtime every night for me to start again in the morning.
- I met cats, chickens, turkeys and pigs and am happy to report that I did not bother any of them or care about them.
- two new things we have discovered this week. I like to swim and I liked being in arlington for an event. 

Do you like my new pictures? I went to an event and there was a nice guy named Drew there who took them. I think I look pretty handsome (even if it was 100 degrees that day...whew!)

Anyway, Ill be hanging out in Nokesville, VA. I am able to go home with you as soon as you are approved to adopt. My foster family says someone is going to be very lucky to have me.

Say hello to Mia, a nine-month-old, 30-pound female Desi dog (a local term for street dog) from India. Mia has quite a rescue story her mom, Furry, was living on the streets of New Delhi with Mia and her three siblings when they were very young, but their mother was unable to feed them due to illness. Mom and pups were taken into Kannan Animal Welfare, a rescue group in New Delhi, and brought back to health. Furry has already been adopted here in the US, and now Mia is the first of her puppies to come in search of a home! 

Because Mia grew up in a rescue facility, life in a home is very new for her. That being said, theres plenty about it she loves! Walks, couches, grassy open spaces, and toys (even sticks will do!), have all been big hits. When Mia is comfortable she is a funny, happy, and athletic girl whos happy to spend a few minutes wrestling or racing with the other dogs in her foster home, and then a few more minutes snuggling with her foster mom. 

Mia thrives on routine and attaches very deeply to her household members. Although she would benefit from ongoing exposure to new situations and people, she would probably be happiest in a low-key household with one or two people, who can help her develop a sense of security and confidence. Those people will find in Mia a dog who is endlessly entertaining, unbelievably charming, and absolutely devoted!

Hi! My name is Will Forte. 

Im a Beagle mix and estimated to be about 1 years old. Im a sweet boy and I currently weigh about 32 lbs. I came to OPH from a shelter in South Carolina. I love it here with my foster family and have been hanging out, getting treated for heartworms (they are yucky) and learning new tricks. I've finished my heartworm treatment (yay!) and am ready to find my forever family. 

Some things about me:
* I LOVE treats. What's that mean to you? It means that I am very trainable to tag along with you during your daily travels and can likely learn lots of fun tricks with you.
* I LOVE to play ball. Hopefully you will too. It helps get my energy out as well so we can watch TV later. 
* I LOVE to get my zoomies out outside. My foster family has told me that's where we do this and we play nice inside and try not to run too much. 
* Do you like to explore? Hey, I do too! Let's go on hikes together and explore all that's out there in Virginia and beyond. 
* AHHH...my crate. It's my quiet and calm time and I don't mind it one bit. It's a pretty great place to nap. 
* I like everyone in my foster family so I'm sure I will like you too! They have older kids and I love being around them. 
* I hope you have some toys or that we can get some. I love to play with them. Wanna go to the pet store and pick some out?
* Here's the best part, are you ready? I have not had any accidents in my foster familys house. My mom says I may need a day to adjust to your house but shes assured me that I will quickly know your routine as well and not have any accidents there too.

I'm a super happy boy, my tail is always wagging. Let's find a time for you to meet me and see what a fun little guy I can be. There are some neat video's featuring none other than me below so you can see me in action. (I'm famous you know, I have my own videos and everything)

Hi! My name is Mera and Im part of the Blockbuster Movie transport that arrived to OPH.

Im guessed to be a Terrier mix and estimated to be about 5 - 6 months old and about 30 lbs. I'm very sweet, timid at first but once I know you, super duper lovable and a velcro dog! Where you are is where I want to be. I love attention and affection and I'm very playful with my foster fur brother. I like all dogs, big and small and I''m a pretty gentle playmate. I like an occasional walk , and I enjoy sunning or sniffing around in the back yard. I'm still a little cautious with things I don't know and people I don't know, but I'm a happy pup. I'm VERY quiet (rarely bark) and I have a beautiful sleek, short, coat of fur. My foster Mom says if you are looking for loving little doggie with a personality that is blooming more and more every day, I'm your girl!!

Looking for a best four legged friend and faithful companion? Then meet Chubbers, the Corgi/Chihuahua mix! Hes about 6 years old and only 15 pounds so he is very portable and can go most anywhere with you. This shy guy came to OPH on 7/3/19 after some time at an overcrowded shelter in VA, where he was scared, but willing to be handled and enjoyed the attention he received from his OPH rescuer. Chubbers is doing really well in his foster home. He has peacefully coexisted with the dogs he has met so far in his foster home. He likes walks and sure enjoys just hanging with his people. He needs slow introductions to new people to allow him to properly get to know visitors and greet them nicely. His foster says he has nice house manners. Does he sound like the perfect pup for you? If so, please apply to adopt this sweet boy today!

Hello! My name is Summertime, Im guessed to be a 2 year old and I currently weigh 67 lbs. I am told I'm very sweet and have a beautiful fluffy coat that is typical of Great Pyrenees. 

I would be great as an only dog. I know a few basic commands and am looking for a family who will adore me. I enjoy the country life and would love a big fenced yard to run and play in. Click here to see how much I love the outdoors! 

Older kids would be my preference too, because I like a quiet relaxed home. I walk nicely on leash and could be *convinced* to go on walks or hikes. I am housebroken, and crate trained....... And my favorite thing is chew toys!

Stay tuned for more updates as the nice people of OPH learn more about me!

Hi there! My name is Chloie and I LOVE to run-run-run at full speed around my fenced-in yard, chase tennis balls, then curl up and be a couch potato. Makes sense since I am three years young. Im a beautiful shepherd mix and 57 pounds. My four puppies were adopted, so I am now looking for my very own forever home. Maybe its with you?

My foster mom says I am a good girl. I love to play with my toys and with my foster mom's personal dog. I love walks. I can be your walking buddy. My foster mom says I prance and jump like a deer. She says she loves everything about me. I may bark when in a new environment or if I know youre making my dinner -- because I'm excited and hungry -- but other than that, Im usually a quiet girl. I do best with slow introductions to other dogs and strangers. I would flourish with an experienced or patient dog owner who can continue to help me learn commands.

I have a guardian angel that thinks I am very special and has sponsored me.

Im just a real sweetheart who wants to love and be loved. Come meet me!

Look into my eyes....you will be hypnotized by my charm!

Hello, my name is Zekke! I am seven months old and estimated to be a husky/white shepherd mix. I arrived at my foster familys house after a super fun flight all the way from NC. Have you been on a plane ride? It was sure fun.

I've been hanging out with my foster family for a few weeks now and while its fun here, I would sure like to find my forever family as well. Below are some fun things my family wants you to know about me.

- I am crate trained. Im quiet in my crate and sleep the night away and know to keep it nice and tidy with my toys. Can't ask for more than that can you?
- I have kept my crate clean and dry. (If I bark in my crate its because I have to go out)
- I appear to be housebroken but foster Mom says accidents can happen in a new environment. Don't worry, we will both be learning when I come home with you but we will both quickly know how to talk to each other. 
- Ive just about mastered this whole leash walking thing. It was brand new to me when I arrived but I like to take walks so I'm learning how to walk like a good boy mom says. I still get excited sometimes and get tangled in foster mom's legs but we are working through it. *** UPDATE *** Zekke has this down. Has recently been out on a busy street and was perfect on the leash with his foster family and with others.
- Im learning other fun things too. I LOVE treats so teaching me things is pretty easy. Ive mastered sit & lay down and am trying REALLY HARD on stay (that one is tough, I like to be with mom when we are outside (she hides cookies in her pockets for me, how can I resist that)) 
 - I appear to be a roll with the punches type of pup. Ive liked everyone, 2 and 4 legged that Ive met so far. 
- Foster Mom says I am one of the easiest fosters they have had. I am quiet, keep the place clean and follow the rules. I think she likes me. :)
- I would do best in a home with older kids (over 12) until I settle down a bit more. Im pretty mouthy still, just like most teenagers. I am working on keeping this under control and am getting better each day. These foster family people don't take any back talk from me about this, they are tough. Mom says my forever people will have to continue to be tough and remind me about this until I fully outgrow it. *** UPDATE ***: Zekke has really gotten this under control. He has recently met children as young as 1 and did really well with them. He seems to understand they are small and to be gentle with them.
- I would be a great hiking or running partner with a little training. Mom & I are doing a bit of running and I LOVE IT! The foster kids started school so we have been super busy and unable to hike but we have talked about it and I'm pretty sure I would like that as well. I love to be busy.
- TOYS! I have discovered TOYS and love them. I am getting pretty good with fetch (I will bring the ball back most of the time, sometimes I get distracted) and love soft toys that make noise. Foster mom told me not to destroy them and I'm doing really good with it. I really am enjoying the toy box here. I like to take one outside each time we go. Silly foster mom picks them all up and brings back inside at bedtime every night for me to start again in the morning.
- I met cats, chickens, turkeys and pigs and am happy to report that I did not bother any of them or care about them.
- two new things we have discovered this week. I like to swim and I liked being in Arlington for an event. 
- I am super dog friendly. Honestly, I have not met another dog that I have not gotten along with.

Do you like my new pictures? I went to an event and there was a nice guy named Drew there who took them. I think I look pretty handsome (even if it was 100 degrees that day...whew!)

Anyway, Ill be hanging out in Nokesville, VA. I am able to go home with you as soon as you are approved to adopt. My foster family says someone is going to be very lucky to have me.

Hi! My name is Titanic and Im part of the Blockbuster Movie transport that arrived to OPH 8-9-19

My foster mom calls me Ginger, Im guessed to be a Chi-weenie Mix and estimated to be about 2 years old. Im a sweet girl and I currently weigh about 15 lbs.
Im housetrained and crate trained! In fact I love my crate! I only bark in the crate after I hear the humans are awake in the morning and Im ready for my breakfast.
I LOVE to snuggle with my humans, nothing is better than a human lap to lay on and get infinite pets.
I also love to play with my foster sibling Zoya. I dont play with other dogs in the dog park yet, just my sister, but she is showing me that other dogs can be fun too.

I walk really well on a leash, and Im so good at recall that my foster mom sometimes drops my leash and lets me walk freely and I stay near her the whole time and always come running when she calls me.

If you are looking for a cute sweet little dog that will love you more than anything and sit on your lap all day long Im the girl for you!!!

Hi! My name is Captain Marvel and Im part of the Blockbuster Movie crew! Im guessed to be a 4 year old, Black and Tan Coonhound mix. Im a sweet girl who LOVES people. I love all of the wonderful people I have met since arriving to OPH. I've never met a stranger! 

My big ears are just a part of my charm. I'm a happy-go-lucky goofy girl. Hounds are just like that! My foster home has three other dogs - and one is a hound so we have lots of fun running in the yard and howling as us hounds do!

This dog tested positive for heartworm disease before arriving to the rescue. Heartworm disease is transmitted to a dog through a bite from an infected mosquito producing a positive test in six months. The dog was treated for the disease prior to transport north. Potential adopters will receive detailed information on the disease and their role in completing the recovery process from OPHs heartworm coordinator. With monthly preventatives, the disease is completely preventable. Read more about heartworm disease here here

Hi! My name is Kirk Cameron but some people call me Tiny. Im guessing I am a Chihuahua/Feist dog mix, but I can only guarantee Im 100 percent dog, harf! Im part of the TV sitcom transport that came to OPH 6-28-19. I cant remember my birthday but I think Im about 1 year old. I still have lots of puppy energy in me and I weigh about 20 pounds. My hooman family had to move and said they couldnt take me to their new place, so they took me to the shelter from which OPH rescued me.

I dont REALLY like going into a crate, because Id rather be playing or cuddling, but once Im in it, Im ok with it. The best part about my crate is the part when Im about to get out of it! I get really really excited to get out of my crate. I have lots of energy to burn!Im practicing walking on a leash with my foster hoomans, and Im getting better, I just need more practice, and more walks HARF!!

My foster hooman has been having me potty outside and Im getting use to that, but I still need more practice. I try really hard to be a good boy, but my foster hooman sometimes puts a diaper on me! With structure and routine I think I can get used to this potty training thing!

Sometimes when I get excited I want to jump up onto or into my hoomans arms, but they keep telling me its not pawlite, so I am trying not to do that! I havent barked much, but if I hear other dogs barking I cant help but join in sometimes. Ive been working on being good and learning basic house manners. I know what to do but I get so \""happy\"" it is hard for me to follow this whole manners thing. Im trying!!!! So far, I have made friends with all of the hoomans and dogs I have met, but I really like playing with other younger dogs the best!

Im telling you I am sweet and loveable and want to please my hoomans. I am full of energy and I love to play. When I have my one on one time with a hooman, I can calm right down for some cuddles and love!I have made my way North in search of my new hooman or family. Is that you???! If so, make sure you apply today!! I wont be available long because Im such a sweet pup!

**I will be at the Richmond Dog Festival Event in Richmond, VA on 9/21/19 from 11am to 4pm at Chimborazo Park 3215 E. Broad St. Richmond, VA 23223 . I would love to meet my furever family so come by and meet me this weekend !

Hi, my name is Harry Pawter! Im part of the Punny Names transport that came to OPH on 7/26/19. I am about 1 or 2 years old and I currently weigh 15 pounds. I am thought to be a Chihuahua mix with possibly some Beagle.

I am a timid dog, but I am very loving. My favorite things to do are snuggle on the couch and play in the yard. I also enjoy playing with other dogs as long as they dont play too rough. Ideally, I would like a home where I will be treated gently with lots of love.

I know some basic manners, but I still have a lot to learn. I am still working on potty training, but Im learning fast. At my foster home, I dont bark or jump often unless I get really excited.

I get scared when I hear loud sounds or see fast movements, but it will just take some time for me to get used to these things in a new home. A little reassurance is something Ill need from my new family members to help me get comfortable. I know the right family will come along and give me the love and patience I need!

I am currently living in a foster home in King William, VA. Please visit me if youre interested in adopting!

Hi! My name is Mera and Im part of the Blockbuster Movie transport that arrived to OPH.

Im guessed to be a Terrier mix and estimated to be about 5 - 6 months old and about 30 lbs. I'm very sweet, timid at first but once I know you, super duper lovable and a velcro dog! Where you are is where I want to be. I love attention and affection and I'm very playful with my foster fur brother. I like all dogs, big and small and I''m a pretty gentle playmate. I like an occasional walk , and I enjoy sunning or sniffing around in the back yard. I'm still a little cautious with things I don't know and people I don't know, but I'm a happy pup. I'm VERY quiet (rarely bark) and I have a beautiful sleek, short, coat of fur. My foster Mom says if you are looking for loving little doggie with a personality that is blooming more and more every day, I'm your girl!!

Hi! My name is Patch and I'm a beautiful 10 month old female Lab Mix. I currently weight about 50lbs. My foster mommy believes I may be HOUSETRAINED! I'm very affectionate and playful.
I have a shiny black coat and pretty face. I like playing with my stuffed toys, running around in the yard, or just laying under a tree chewing on a bone. My energy level may be just what you need for a running buddy! I don't jump up on people and try very hard to do what I'm told. I'm well behaved in my yard and house as long as I am supervised. I'm doing very well responding to verbal commands. I've learned how to use my underground electric fence as well as learning to respect the above ground fence. Everyday I'm getting better with house manners and respecting my doggy playmates. I play very well with my fostered buddy Bela, who you can find on this website! At my first adoption event I was very well behaved while meeting new people and dogs. I played very nicely with large dogs and a very small dog while supervised.

I hope to find my forever family soon. Could that be you?

This dog tested positive for Lyme before arriving to the rescue. Lymes is a very common type of bacteria that infects dogs and other species and is spread by ticks. Lymes is not contagious to humans or other pets. The only way to get this disease is to be bitten by a tick that carries it. The treatment is typically 21-30 days of antibiotics. This dog started treatment upon arriving to the rescue.

Are you looking for the perfect, smartest little puppy? STOP right here, you found her! Ribeye is the last of the Steak Pups to find her forever home. Her life started out a bit rough, she was surrendered with her siblings who all were undernourished and scared. She made her way to OPH and has grown so much both physically and mentally. She is amazingly smart, already mastering the \""sit\"" command, does well in a crate and housebreaking has been a breeze. She wants to love and please her fosters ALL of the time. Ribeye enjoys the company of both her humans and her foster fur siblings. If she is not sitting with her foster mom, she is tumbling on the floor with one if not several of the other dogs in her foster home. 

Ribeye is 3 months old and about 9 pounds. 

Because she is a baby, she will require an adopter who is not out of the home for more than 4 hours at one time to continue her training - no exceptions! She is up-to-date on age appropriate vaccines and will need to be altered at the appropriate age per the spay/neuter agreement you will be signing at the time of adoption.

Please note that because she is so young, she has only received 2 sets of the required 3 sets puppy vaccinations. This is very IMPORTANT because it means that her immune system will not be fully functioning until about 16 weeks of age.

Hi! My name is Mai Tai and also known as Honey. I am happy and ready to live life to the limits! I am a young dog- a year plus young and weigh about 42 lbs. I am very loving and affectionate. Can't get enough pets and give enough kisses. And I sure love to play and be outside exploring everything I see and smell. Walks are on my top 5 things that I love!.

 I am trainable and understand commands like sit and stay. To me, I understand that bed is my crate and night, night is bedtime. Boy do I love car rides. I am ready to go whenever and where you want to take me. I do love having all of your attention so perhaps I may be best as an only dog. I am not sure I like cats as friends so perhaps I may be best in a home without them. I would love to have an adopter who wants to play with me and make sure that I get my daily exercise. 

We could have lots of fun bonding as we do those things together. What do you think? Am I the honey sweet dog for your life? If so I would love to meet you!

Hi! My name is Kirk Cameron but some people call me Tiny. Im guessing I am a Chihuahua/Feist dog mix, but I can only guarantee Im 100 percent dog, harf! Im part of the TV sitcom transport that came to OPH 6-28-19. I cant remember my birthday but I think Im about 1 year old. I still have lots of puppy energy in me and I weigh about 20 pounds. My hooman family had to move and said they couldnt take me to their new place, so they took me to the shelter from which OPH rescued me.

I dont REALLY like going into a crate, because Id rather be playing or cuddling, but once Im in it, Im ok with it. The best part about my crate is the part when Im about to get out of it! I get really really excited to get out of my crate. I have lots of energy to burn!Im practicing walking on a leash with my foster hoomans, and Im getting better, I just need more practice, and more walks HARF!!

My foster hooman has been having me potty outside and Im getting use to that, but I still need more practice. I try really hard to be a good boy, but my foster hooman sometimes puts a diaper on me! With structure and routine I think I can get used to this potty training thing!

Sometimes when I get excited I want to jump up onto or into my hoomans arms, but they keep telling me its not pawlite, so I am trying not to do that! I havent barked much, but if I hear other dogs barking I cant help but join in sometimes. Ive been working on being good and learning basic house manners. I know what to do but I get so \""happy\"" it is hard for me to follow this whole manners thing. Im trying!!!! So far, I have made friends with all of the hoomans and dogs I have met, but I really like playing with other younger dogs the best!

Im telling you I am sweet and loveable and want to please my hoomans. I am full of energy and I love to play. When I have my one on one time with a hooman, I can calm right down for some cuddles and love!I have made my way North in search of my new hooman or family. Is that you???! If so, make sure you apply today!! I wont be available long because Im such a sweet pup!

**I will be at the Richmond Dog Festival Event in Richmond, VA on 9/21/19 from 11am to 4pm at Chimborazo Park 3215 E. Broad St. Richmond, VA 23223 . I would love to meet my furever family so come by and meet me this weekend !

\""Under your scars I pray you're like a shooting star in the rain. You're everything that feels like home to me.\"" From the song \""Scars\"" by Godsmack

We all have scars, some just can't be seen. While Fritos has some scars of a possible rough life, she lives up to her original name of Sunshine. 

Are you looking for a dog who: 
* Will love you unconditionally until the very end? 
* Loves to be outside playing ball, going for walks, car rides, maybe runs or possibly a frisbee partner? 
* Will keep your yard critter free? 
* Comes pre-loaded with a billion kisses? 
* Is pre-trained for belly rubs? 
* Enjoys learning new tricks? 
* Can be self-entertained with toys and bones? 
* Is already house and crate trained?

If so, then I am the PERFECT girl for you!!! If you want to take me to training, that would be fantastic! After a proper introduction, I'm doing fantastic with the 3 other dogs in my foster home (see pictures and video). I love being loved on, petted and receive ear scratches. I am willing to please in exchange for a loving home. Will that be with you? Come on, let's love life together scars and all!

Hello! My name is Summertime, Im guessed to be a 2 year old and I currently weigh 67 lbs. I am told I'm very sweet and have a beautiful fluffy coat that is typical of Great Pyrenees. 

I would be great as an only dog. I know a few basic commands and am looking for a family who will adore me. I enjoy the country life and would love a big fenced yard to run and play in. Click here to see how much I love the outdoors! 

Older kids would be my preference too, because I like a quiet relaxed home. I walk nicely on leash and could be *convinced* to go on walks or hikes. I am housebroken, and crate trained....... And my favorite thing is chew toys!

Stay tuned for more updates as the nice people of OPH learn more about me!

Hi! My name is Bela! I'm a HOUSETRAINED female boxer mix, around 3 years old, and weight about 50lbs. I'm playful, affectionate, and crate trained. I love to cuddle on your lap and play with my toys. I get along great with my home companions including Patch, another foster dog you can find right here on this website! I do need a slow introduction to new dogs and people. I cannot live in a home with cats. While outside I'm usually quiet unless I see the neighbors and want to say hi! I respect my fence and can be left alone, loose in my foster's house with no worries! Meeting new people and other animals makes me get scared so I should be crated (which I go into very nicely) before visitors arrive. My foster mommy says I'm an easy and great dog to have in the family. If you are looking for a new friend like me please apply to adopt me. I've been looking for my forever family. Could it be you?

Flannery is 2 years old and weighs about 30 lbs with a look and a personality like a min-pin. She is an energetic, busy girl who LOVES to go for lots of walks and would likely even be a nice running buddy. She is smart and curious and will thrive on challenges. She just completed an Intro to Agility class and was a SUPERSTAR! With more training, she could be a serious competitor. She has mastered the tunnel, A-frame, hoop, and can jump anything you put in front of her. She has also been introduced to the teeter and the dog walk. Flannery will fetch anything - balls, frisbees, toys, even rocks!

Her funny personality, keeps us all chuckling. She loves to play with toys and when no one is available to play with, she will just toss toys to herself! Flannery is also a first-class snuggler and a Phillies fan.

Like her namesake, Flannery is a spunky southern girl. She will need an adopter who has some dog experience. That steller brain of hers could easily take over the show. She will do best in a home without children, while she adores children, she has a tendency to nip grabby hands. She gets along fine with other dogs, does fine with cats, has great recall off-leash, and is housebroken and crate-trained. She is smart, willing, intense, athletic, and speedy. While Flannery can be a quirky dog, she is also a sweetheart who will keep you entertained and adored for years to come. Looking for a best, best, best friend? Look no further.

 Meet The Hobbit - known fondly to her foster family as Lady Arwen or Lady for short. She is a 45-50 pound, one year old, beagle/spaniel/lab mix is our best guess. She has gorgeous creamy coloring and luxurious fur - hard to keep your hand out of it. And she doesn't mind the gentle petting and attention at all. She has her nose to the ground all the time - perhaps a nod to her beagle heritage? And she has long silky fur that one might associate with a spaniel. She is so gentle and sweet, and has done beautifully with children, other dogs and car rides. Each day we see more of her exquisite personality shining through. She's very loving and sweet. She's also smart and loves to cuddle. She's been really great with our 2 year old and our 12 year old twins, but our 7 year old is a little too rambunctious for her.

More about this darling girl:
- She is house trained in her foster home, and has visited homes of family members and remembered her house manners there as well.
- She is crate trained, and knows that her crate is her personal den and uses it at time to get some downtime, to relax and unwind. She is a smart girl understanding her personal space.
- She is working on improving her leash skills. She likely never walked on a leash before coming to her foster home, and she likes to pull. With training she is improving and to become really adept and walk on a loose leash, her adoptive family will need to continue the training process.
- She may be shy when meeting new people, but she has impeccable manners - not a jumper
- She is learning her house manners - she likes being on the couch which is fine in her foster home, but she may have to be trained otherwise in her adoptive home. She is very agile and has jumped up to get food from the table. She is learning quickly that is is not acceptable in her foster home. 
- She is generally quiet. She will alert at random times but it's few and far between.
- She is learning to trust humans more thoroughly and quickly, and her fosters are consciously socializing her to help her build confidence. She would rather people kneel down to pet her instead of looming over her. She gets nervous if someone comes up behind her too quickly and can startle if she is bumped into by accident. I think she needs more work on trusting humans in general. She shows no reactivity or aggression, but retreats to her crate if she feels overwhelmed. 
- She loves to run around in the backyard. She loves to play with other dogs. She seems to be a moderate energy dog and she is still trying to figure out how it all works inside a home.
- She loves to play with other dogs.
- She has not been exposed to cats, but her foster thinks she could do well with a confident cat. She's tried to go after squirrels on walks and birds get her attention.
- She will do best with a patient adoptive home where they can continue to show her that humans are a good thing and being apart of a family is where it's at. Possibly someone with another confident dog to help her to continue to gain confidence in a home.

This dog tested positive for Anaplasmosis before arriving to the rescue. Anaplasmosis is a very common type of bacteria that infects dogs and other species and is spread by ticks. Anaplasmosis is not contagious to humans or other pets. The only way to get this disease is to be bitten by a tick that carries it. The treatment is typically 21-30 days of antibiotics. This dog started treatment upon arriving to the rescue.

Since they had me come out of my crate, they've been working with me a little more every day and they tell me how proud of me they are for making progress every day. I've been with my foster family for about a month now and I've gotten much more comfortable with them. I love to follow my foster mom around the house everywhere she goes. I wag my tail and do my happy dance when I see my foster family now. I went from being scared of them, to loving getting pets and treats from them. I love treats! I hardly ever run into my crate when they are home now, because I enjoy being out in the house with my foster fam. I do great with going potty outside in my little puppy pen. I stay in a crate when my humans leave the house and at bedtime. I have 3 human siblings (ages 7-11) in my foster family and 2 canine siblings that are both close to my size. I have done well with my human siblings because they are very calm and patient with me. I don't think I would like to be with young kids that don't know how to be patient and calm with me and give me my space to build up trust with them. I now love playing with dog toys and chasing balls. I love running around and playing with my 2 year old canine brother.  I'm not a big fan of my older canine foster brother though. I have come a long way during my time in my foster home, so although I'll have a transition period to go through in my new home, I know I would blossom with having a fur-ever family. I would love a family that understands that I will need time and patience to build up trust and know that they are good and love me and help me to understand that the world isn't so scary. Will you be that family?

Im Miss Alma. I'm a tiny lady looking for a place to chill to call my furever home. I came from a hoarding home in SC and so I'm learning to cuddle with my foster mama and explore the home. I get along with other dogs but I get grumpy about my space and prefer to sleep solo. My hobbies include eating and napping on very plush bedding. I am maybe 5lb but I sure do enjoy my canned dinners and my foster mama even warms them up for me because my precious eyes convince her I require that. These hoomans that cater to me make me get up and walk around. I'll do best with a home with older kids that understand to give me space. I haven't been cat tested but by my chill level I don't see it even phasing me. 
And I think Iâm about 7 years old, but Iâm not sure. I will need a dental and to be on canned food only.

My name is Zeus and Iâm a special boy, according to my foster mom. I have come a long way in my foster home in learning how to \""dog\"".  I started life in a home that hoarded dogs, so I didn't get the best care and the love and attention I needed.  Because of this situation, I was defensive and a bite risk to start.  I like it when you get down on my level and don't tower over me.  You are big and I am very small, so you look like a giant coming at me.  

I have found that I like pillows and they give me security, in that I can hide in them if I want to.  I also am treat motivated (fish based treats are my favorite), so that will be a good way to continue my training. Once Iâm comfortable with you, I love to snuggle close and get belly rubs. I do love to give kisses but I can get a little overboard!

I am working on leash skills and not being so scared with quick movements, loud sounds, and going through doorways.  I like to walk with a harness on and I am learning that I should do my potty business outside. While I am learning, I do understand about potty pads inside. 

I like having a K9 companion, but I would not do well with cats in my forever home.  If you are willing to work with me, I know I could be a great dog for you.

Iâm a small thing at just 10lbs! 

I was just rescued about a month ago from a hoarding situation so a majority of the world makes me quite nervous but Iâm slowly settling into my foster home. 

I love being outside and just laying out on the porch. Think quick about taking me for a walk cause leashes are scary for now. 

Iâm curious about my foster humans. Iâll go up and sniff and lick them when they arenât noticing but if they try to touch me I scurry off cause Iâm not ready for that much attention just yet. So no small humans for me because if they donât understand the space I need right now I will bite them. 

There are 5 other dogs living with me. The first couple of days I growled when they came near my personal space but we are growing on each other though I would probably do best either as the only dog or just co-habitating with a dog that doesnât want to play.  

Iâm also heartworm positive. Right now Iâm taking my meds before my treatment gets scheduled so Iâll need the low activity life I already prefer until my treatment date and 30 days after.

WWW.CARERVA.COM

Mickey is a precious little fellow who was born sometime around the first of the year.  He came to us with his littermate, Minnie, from a home in southern VA where neither was given any human handling or socialization.  Although both are very sweet, they are skittish and each will need a home with a patient owner able to provide a consistent schedule and lots of human interaction.  We expect Mickey to be less than 10 pounds when fully grown.

Mickey is in good health.  He has had his puppy vaccines and will be neutered and microchipped as a part of our adoption process.

CARE Rescue is  foster-base rescue located in Richmond, VA.  We do not have a facility for you to come to meet animals at.  You must visit our weekly adoption stand (calendar on our website) to meet the adoptable dogs.  Out of area adoptions can only be facilitated when we are able to find a volunteer to do a home visit for us and when the potential adopter already has a veterinary reference."

As far as potty training in my foster home, that is a work in progress, but I am doing very well. I'm a little slow to trust, but I warm up pretty quick.

She does great with the other dogs (especially loves bigger dogs) and loves to play with them. Because she is so hesitant of people, taking her out on a leash is an event, but she has no problem using a doggie door or just going outside to a fenced in yard.  She crates well, has had no potty accidents in her foster home, gets along with cats, She has made a lot of progress in her foster home so stay tuned for further updates.

This is a link to a good article about working with shy dogs like Mika.

I am pretty old and tired, my eyes and ears are not working so well these days. My brother and I ended up with the fine people at the Old Dominion Humane Society after our elderly owner passed way. My brother was a little younger and lucky enough to get adopted, I miss him but I am happy for him. Like most older gentlemen I have some hair loss but with grooming I am looking much better. I spend most of my day sleeping and resting, I sleep quietly in my kennel at night and I have been doing really well about doing my business outside. I do fine with other dogs as long as they do not keep me from napping. I walk on a leash well outside but really struggle with stairs. I think this is because of my poor eyesight. Good news is I only weigh about 10 pounds so I am not heavy to carry. I get along with everyone and enjoy getting pets, oh and kids are great too! I know I might be as cute as some of the young pups and yes I am in the later chapters of my life but I am willing to give you every ounce of love I have left. If you are looking for a sweet quiet older gentlemen to warm your lap in the coming months then I am your guy. Please stop by to see me even if it is just for a short visit.  
 
Thanks,

Wes

Well, that's my real name, but my friends call me Ray Ray or little bit around here. I'm new to this household and I've only been here a few days, but I settled right in! They say I'm very well tempered and loveable (what?? people think they can talk about me while I'm in the room and I'm not gonna hear them?). I'm kind of a snuggle bug if I was bigger I'd be a great spooning partner. Especially burried in a fuzzy blanket! The other dogs here are just fine with me too, sometimes they get a bit aggressive with playtime, but I can hold my own. I'm being treated for flea bites currently and I'm hoping my hair fills in as time goes on. Those little bugs really bother me. I'm small, but don't let that fool you, I LOVE to eat! Dinner time is my favorite and I try to show it with excitement and love! I pretty much do my business outside, but I don't like the rain so I have had a couple of accidents in the hallway (hey but at least they're small). Car rides are cool, it's a big world out there to see! I'm ok with the leash, but I'd rather just cruise around freely. The other dogs go a hootin' and hollering about the crate, but I don't mind it, seems like a safe place for me! This place has a few dogs, I haven't seen a kid or a cat yet, but I think from what I've heard I'll do fine with them. I like it here ok, but sure would love a place to call my own and be part of a forever family! Ask about me, I'm hoping to get an application soon!I am about 3 years old and about 15lbs.

Note: My leg has been bothering me and my x-rays have been done.  We are awaiting the results,  I am hoping itâs just arthritis and nothing worse.

She arrived at the Homeward Trails Adoption Center from a high kill shelter in southern, VA almost 3 years ago! She is so very sweet but never had a lot of human contact before so is now learning to trust humans. Christy draws comfort from her furry foster friends. She was at the shelter for over 100 days and set to be euthanized before we rescued her back in 2016. While Christy is afraid of leash walking, she does GREAT if she can have free roam of the yard. Once she is settled in a home, just say the magic word \""potty\"" and there she goes! Christy has learned that it's ok to come say hello to her foster humans while they are home and she feels comfortable just hanging out watching tv too. Christy is house trained, great with dogs and cats. She never gets into mischief and is crate trained but not really needed, a nice soft bed on the floor with a bone for her to enjoy is her idea of a good time while she adjust to her new surroundings. Can you give Christy a chance to have a place to call home, a home with a confident friend to help show her the ropes? She's been in loving foster homes but NEVER has she had one to call her own. After 3 years, it's Christy's turn to find a home! Apply to adopt her today! Breed Estimate: Beagle mix Gender: Female Approximate weight: 55 lbs Approximate age: 5 years Location: foster home Cratetrained: yes but not needed Coat Type: silky smooth Personality: Shy The adoption fee for this dog is $25. This fee INCLUDES spay and microchip. If the animal you are adopting is not already spayed/neutered, you will be required to sign a contract legally obligating you to have the animal altered. Please contact your HT rep to learn about exclusive low-cost spay/neuter options made available only to HT adopters! Every adopted Homeward Trails animal comes with 30 days of free pet health insurance. We are proud to partner with the following veterinarians who offer a free first exam for your animal, exclusively for HT adopters: Caring Hands Animal Hospital, Palisades Veterinary Clinic, Sunshine Animal Hospital and Clarendon Animal Care and all VCA Animal Hospitals.

We also provide a 30-minute phone consult with a professional dog trainer at Fur-Get Me Not within the first 30 days of adopting - just for HT adopters in the Arlington/Alexandria area. Start your new dog out on the right foot with this valuable, expert advice and guidance FREE! You can save animals like this one by becoming a foster!

He is looking for a dog savy family that can help teach him not to be mouthy. No small kids for this guy! Sometimes he can even leave marks! Ouch! He is such a ham, though!

5772,45108263,Arlington,VA,VA,,1.0,,,Virginia,,VA,-78.6569,37.4316,-78.6569,37.4316,18283,VA774,https://www.petfinder.com/dog/belle-and-amp-taco-45108263/va/arlington/worthy-dog-rescue-va774/?referrer_id=9825d0c8-29d4-4feb-9841-e9bfcd37fd1b,Dog,Dog,Chihuahua,,True,False,,,,Young,Female,Small,,True,True,,False,True,,True,True,Belle (&amp; Taco),adoptable,2019-06-28T17:44:46+0000,22204,US,DC,2019-09-20,"This sweet bonded pair, Taco & Belle, have had unfortunate luck in their very short lives. They lost their original owner suddenly to a stroke and were passed around to different family members for a few months. They ended up with the 80-year-old grandmother who was legally blind and taking care of her disabled son, so she didn't have the time or bandwidth to take on two young dogs. A family member reached out to Worthy Dog for help, and we gladly took them in.

The duo came to N. VA and were adopted in February by a very sweet couple, and we thought they had found their forever home. Sadly, their current mom, Lynn, who is only in her 30's, is going through a significant and unexpected health challenge, and suffering from kidney failure. She had a kidney transplant 18 years ago and was in great health when she adopted the pups. The couple was so very excited to have these dogs, and even started an Instagram account for Taco & Bell to share updates

About two months ago, Lynn's kidney started failing, and she ended up in the hospital for weeks. She is now on the transplant list waiting for a donor and has to do dialysis 3 to 4 days a week. She travels from VA to MD to a military facility for treatment, and the dialysis wipes out her energy when she gets home. Lynn has been the primary caregiver for the pups and had the flexibility to work from home. Her husband is active duty, and travels frequently, so he's not home during the day to help. Her mom and friends have been helping out, and kept Taco & Bell when she was hospitalized, but it's not a long-term solution.

In the interest of the dogs, Lynn has made the difficult decision to rehome them. She feels they aren't getting the time and attention they deserve, and with another transplant surgery in her future, she may be out of commission for an extended period. She wants to find a home for them before transplant surgery, and have peace of mind that they will be well taken care of. She is fostering them until a great family can be found.

TACO & BELLE

Taco & Belle have been together their whole lives and are a bonded pair. Taco is more timid, but loves his buddy Belle, and looks to her for reassurance. Taco needs a little more time to settle in and trust, but once he connects, he's very trusting and affectionate. Both dogs fancy themselves lap dogs once they get to know you.

This adorable duo loves to play and will keep each other entertained during the day. They are crate trained, enjoy their daily walks, and are potty trained, but do need regular potty breaks. Belle lets you know she needs to go out, and Taco will follow her lead once he settles in. Initially, Taco was prone to marking or excited peeing when he was unexpectedly picked up, but that was more about nerves. They used a belly band to settle him in, and both dogs have been trained on pee pads. Lynn will leave them gated in the kitchen when she goes in for treatment, and has a dog walker or her mom come in when she's out of the home for more than 5 or 6 hours.

These two pups are very connected, so we will only adopt them out as a pair. They are buddies who love to play and nap together and keep each other entertained. They are both afraid of loud noises and strangers and need time to acclimate to visitors, but once they know the person, like grandma, they are all excitement and kisses.

We feel a quiet, calm home is the best fit for them - an adult or senior couple, or empty nesters would be ideal. If you are looking for two little pups who will add joy and much entertainment to your life, please apply today. They are long overdue for their forever home.

You can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to http://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.

A family member reached out to Worthy Dog for help, and we gladly took them in.

The duo came to N. VA and were adopted in February by a very sweet couple, and we thought they had found their forever home. Sadly, their current mom, Lynn, who is only in her 30's, is going through a significant and unexpected health challenge, and suffering from kidney failure. She had a kidney transplant 18 years ago and was in great health when she adopted the pups. The couple was so very excited to have these dogs, and even started an Instagram account for Taco & Bell to share updates

About two months ago, Lynn's kidney started failing, and she ended up in the hospital for weeks. She is now on the transplant list waiting for a donor and has to do dialysis 3 to 4 days a week. She travels from VA to MD to a military facility for treatment, and the dialysis wipes out her energy when she gets home. Lynn has been the primary caregiver for the pups and had the flexibility to work from home. Her husband is active duty, and travels frequently, so he's not home during the day to help. Her mom and friends have been helping out, and kept Taco & Bell when she was hospitalized, but it's not a long-term solution.

In the interest of the dogs, Lynn has made the difficult decision to rehome them. She feels they aren't getting the time and attention they deserve, and with another transplant surgery in her future, she may be out of commission for an extended period. She wants to find a home for them before transplant surgery, and have peace of mind that they will be well taken care of. She is fostering them until a great family can be found.

TACO & BELLE

Taco & Belle have been together their whole lives and are a bonded pair. Taco is more timid, but loves his buddy Belle, and looks to her for reassurance. Taco needs a little more time to settle in and trust, but once he connects, he's very trusting and affectionate. Both dogs fancy themselves lap dogs once they get to know you.

This adorable duo loves to play and will keep each other entertained during the day. They are crate trained, enjoy their daily walks, and are potty trained, but do need regular potty breaks. Belle lets you know she needs to go out, and Taco will follow her lead once he settles in. Initially, Taco was prone to marking or excited peeing when he was unexpectedly picked up, but that was more about nerves. They used a belly band to settle him in, and both dogs have been trained on pee pads. Lynn will leave them gated in the kitchen when she goes in for treatment, and has a dog walker or her mom come in when she's out of the home for more than 5 or 6 hours.

These two pups are very connected, so we will only adopt them out as a pair. They are buddies who love to play and nap together and keep each other entertained. They are both afraid of loud noises and strangers and need time to acclimate to visitors, but once they know the person, like grandma, they are all excitement and kisses.

We feel a quiet, calm home is the best fit for them - an adult or senior couple, or empty nesters would be ideal. If you are looking for two little pups who will add joy and much entertainment to your life, please apply today. They are long overdue for their forever home.

You can also help save dogs like this one by becoming a foster, providing a rescue dog with a temporary home and giving them the love and care they need until they are permanently adopted. Every person who fosters is directly responsible for saving the life of a dog, because we can only save as many dogs as we have foster families available to welcome them into their homes. If you think you might be interested in becoming a foster and want to learn more, please go to http://foster.worthydog.org and fill out an application.

Iâm a small fellow at just 18lb but Iâm a year old so no growing for me! 

What do I want the most? A big spoon. I want some humans that I can snuggle with all night kinda like I am a teddy bear. Hey if you want to nickname me Teddy I wouldnât even mind! 

Iâd also like some toys. Fluffier the better. Oh and some siblings to play with... 2-legged or 4... doesnât matter! 

And I want breakfast for breakfast lunch and dinner. Yeah eggs... theyâre yummy. I mean bacon is too... but eggs I like. 

Itâs ok if you come with a crate. Iâm good in the crate! Now.... Iâm still working on mastering my potty skills but if I had to guess you were in diapers at 1 too! 

Iâm working on resource guarding, not jumping 6 foot fences, and getting along with dogs smaller than me (little man syndrome).  Iâd be great for an only dog house if thatâs your situation.

So what do you say... we snuggling tonight?

*****************

Old Man came to us from rural VA where a local hunt club dumped him at the shelter for some unknown reason. It's obvious he did not receive the best of care as he is in rough shape, with bad skin, raggedy ears and scars all over his face.. and he is heartworm positive to boot. Despite the neglect, Old Man is the sweetest of sweet. He seems to get along with everyone and he is learning there is a good life for him, even if he had to wait until his golden years to get it. Old Man has started his heartworm treatment which will be finished around the beginning of April. In the meantime, he is spending his days in a loving foster home, being spoiled in the manner he deserves. He is around 37 lbs.

Wink is a miniature poodle that went through so much before he came to us.  When Wink was rescued, he was in terrible condition and every square inch of his body was pink and he was itching constantly.  Vet examined Wink and diagnosed him with scabbies, chronic ear infection (which explained why he was snappy when someone try to pet him in the head) and in addition, he was heartworm positive.  It was obvious that such a tiny guy was an outdoor dog in someone's house in the past, and his hair/ skin/ general health condidion was not managed at all.  While he was getting vetted to get the proper medical treatment, he was in the middle of a fight amongst dogs at the shelter, and due to the shock and trauma, one of his eyes popped out which gave him a permanent damage (blinded in one eye).  The ER vet was able to place the eye back in. but not able to save the vision sadly.

But, Wink is a survivor! He completed his heartwarm treatment and fully recovered from scabbies. He still has eczema on his skin, and will need to receive monthly injection of Cytopoint a few more months to be permanently cured of his skin condition, but that is easily obtainable, our foster mom thinks.  Wink was seen by a cardiologist since his arrival in the US, and the symptoms for his heart is also controllable with daily heart meds (Vetmedin, 1.25mg x2 daily).  We were told he does not need to be on Lasix, as long as his breathing is monitored visually.  Wink did however developed symptoms for diabetes since his arrival, and now, he is currently receiving insulin twice a day at his foster home which makes things a bit more complicated.  What a life Wink has..

With so much that Wink went through, we are looking for a family that will shower Wink with love, trust and belief.  Wink is doing his best, but he is afraid of the insulin shots, and he does not know why he is getting poked every day.  His foster mommy is working with a trainer, so that Wink is being less sensitive of his shots currently.  This is a life long commitment, and BFA does not take it lightly.  Wink is still a great companion, and has so much love to give to his family.  Once you get the routine down, giving daily insulin shots won't stop you from loving Wink, because Wink is really that special...(ask his foster moms in the areas, we have a several of them!) We also have to look into whether the adopter is able to afford Wink's medical expanses too since Wink has a several special needs conditions what need routine check up, and will need to be given medicines for life.

If you think you have a small space in your home for a dog that definitely need your help to survive, please consider Wink.  Wink is easy to take care of because he is potty trained, does not exhibit any separation anxiety, and easy to get along with people and other dogs.  We are very sure that Wink will be forever thankful to you and your family, and show you his unconditional love.  

We believe people who adopt rescue animals because they are willing to accept a bit of imperfection, and willing to embrace, work/ train and love them no matter what baggage the animal had in the past. It can be challenging, but extremely rewarding. We have seen amazing transformation in our adopted dogs who have been with loving families, and it is our goal to provide all of them with the opportunity. We are at our happiest when we see photos of our adopted animals smile with the new adoptive family, and we hope to find Wink a loving family who would do the same. 

 Please consider adopting Wink and making him part of your family! If you would like to apply to adopt Wink, you can download an application here:

(A home with no cats is best for Max)If you are interested in Max please fill out an application at www.henricohumane.org/adopt/application-for-dogs before coming to our next adoption event. Our adoption events are every Saturday, excluding holidays, at the Petco next to Trader Joe's in Short Pump from 11:00 to 2:00 (11331 West Broad Street, Glen Allen, VA). Please note that not all dogs attend our adoption events so to find out if a particular dog will be coming please email dogs@henricohumane.org."

\""Hi, I am Buster. I am an adult male bulldog that ended up in the county kill shelter when an animal control picked me up as a stray. Sadly, my owners never came for me.

Humans over look me for little dogs and tiny cute puppies. But the workers tell me I am cute and they don't understand why I am still here. They say that they would take me if they could, but I wonder why they cant?

They were surrendered along with 3 siblings and from what we are told, all 5 of them had been kept in cages outdoors.  We were also told that Felix is 11 years old, although that is hard to believe when we see him playing with the young puppy in his foster home.  Felix is timid, but does not act like a dog who was kept in his cage for his entire life, so at some point he probably had a home where he interacted with his family.  Hopefully he can find a home like that again.  He is sweet and loving with his foster mom and dad.

Unfortunately, Felix does not get along with all of the dogs in his foster home and would probably do best as the only dog in the house, despite his fondness for the pup that he plays with.  He is extremely interested in cats and it would not be a good idea to leave him alone with one.

Oh, and Felix is missing a foot.  He gets around so well that I often forget to mention that!  If you look closely at the last photo, you can see that his right back leg is just a stump.  Sometimes he limps on 3 legs and sometimes he actually walks on the stump.  He doesn't seem to know he has a \""handicap\"".

Felix was very matted when he came to us so we shaved his hair.  Now that it has grown out, he looks exactly like a large Yorkie (he weighs about 15 lbs.)

If you think you might be the one to give this sweet little dog a home for the rest of his life, please email cosmozcause@gmail.com"

She is up to date on vaccines, microchipped, heartworm negative, on flea/heartworm prevention, house trained, crate trained, and leash trained.

Athena comes to us from the animal shelter in Spotsylvania, VA. From what we can gather, she has already had at least 3 homes before ending up in the shelter. In March 2018, a family acquired her from someone who was giving her away. In May, they surrendered her to the Stafford County Animal Control because they were moving. A few days later, she was adopted by another family. She did well with them for a while, but then she began to guard her pregnant human and show teeth at the other little humans in the house. They surrendered her to the Spotsylvania Animal Shelter on Nov. 1, 2018. 

Athena is SUCH a good girl, the shelter was very persistent about asking the Akita rescues to take her. Finally the stars aligned and we had a space open for her! She is fantastic in the crate in her foster home and regularly goes to doggy daycare! She would be happy in a home with a large male to play with or as an only pet.

Sadie is a darling little Yorkie who is about 8 years old.  She came to us with another older gal after her owner died, and the extended family was not able to keep them.  Both were in pretty sad shape with horrible skin which we were told was allergies, but good hygiene and nutrition, plus flea eradication, has allowed the skin to completely clear.  Paperwork from the previous veterinarian indicates that most care was declined.

Since coming to our rescue Sadie has been spayed, had a mammary tumor (benign) removed and tested, been given a dental cleaning with extractions, been given all vaccines, had extensive blood testing to make certain there were no underlying conditions and been microchipped.  With good care and her small size, Sadie should live a very long time and enjoy life!  Sadie loves being a lap dog.  We are seeking a quiet and predictable home for her since that is what she is used to.

Flash is a rare beautiful blue merle male chihuahua who is 1-2 years old.  He came to us from a local shelter partner after being surrendered by his owner.  This little fellow has been passed from owner to owner and has understandably developed some separation anxiety issues that caused the current owner to feel unable to properly care for him.  In his short time with us we see a wonderful dog who would do very well in a home with an experienced dog owner that has a very predictable schedule.  Once Flash has someone he can trust, a routine he can count on and some TLC, he will be a wonderful pet!

Flash is in good health.  As a part of our rescue protocols, Flash will have all vaccinations, blood tests, a microchip implant and neuter surgery.

Daphne is a darling female chihuahua who recently came to us from a regional shelter in a nearby rural community.  We have little information about her, but we know she and several other chihuahuas were taken from a hoarding situation.  Daphne appears to be one of the lucky ones who has had some level of human socialization and is not fearful of people.  We believe she is a younger adult, and are still gathering information about her.

Daphne likes adults who are kind and patient.  She is quick with a wag of the tail and to give kisses. We believe that she will thrive in a patient home without larger animals, and she will begin to understand the joy of being a beloved pet.  Delilah appears to be a healthy girl.  She will be given her vaccinations and will be spayed and microchipped as a part of her adoption process.

Chyna is again available for adoption!  This beautiful girl originally came to us in April in medical distress.  She had ingested corn cobs and was unable to pass them.  Her owners were unable to afford to provide her with the life-saving surgery she needed, and they surrendered her to our veterinarian.  We were happy to be able to work with our vet (who we think is just the most awesome vet ever, by the way) to provide for Chyna's immediate surgery on a Saturday afternoon.  We then had Chyna vaccinated, spayed and microchipped, and in May she was adopted.  Sadly her adopted family had a job change and she has returned to our care.

We believe Chyna is getting close to a year old now, and she is a big, beautiful, happy, gentle girl.  She is in great health, and she has been housebroken while with her last family.  We are seeking a home for Chyna with knowledgable and responsible owners able to handle a large dog.  Because she is a young lady, she will need an adopter able to properly exercise her.  We would love an active adopter for her!  Chyna has not been recently weighed.  Our best guess is that she is about 50 pounds now.

Blossom is a two year old chihuahua mix who came to CARE from a local shelter.  She was surrendered by an owner who was no longer able to care for her.  The owner stated that Blossom was housebroken, slept in the bed, loved riding in the car and playing with squeaky toys and was a joy to own.  The only negative mentioned was that Blossom can be an escape artist so will need a secure home.  She is fully grown at about 15 pounds. we believe she may have some Jack Russell terrier in her, as she behaves as one does.

As a part of her adoption process, Blossom has received all her vaccines and has had blood tests to rule out heart worms and tick borne illnesses.  This coming week she will be spayed and microchipped.  We believe she will make an awesome addition to most families, especially those who are active.

Introducing Rigby, a cute little mixed breed dog who is about 3 years old and fully grown at 15 pounds.    The first question most people ask is what the breed of the dog is, and the truth is, we haven't a clue!  We see dachshund, Jack Russell terrier, pug and chihuahua, but your guess is as good as any!  Rigby is a happy, healthy dog who would love to have a home of his own!

Rigby is in good health.  He has been neutered and microchipped, given all his vaccines and has had blood tests to rule out heart worms and tick borne illness.  Rigby will do best in a home with experienced pet owners who have a secure environment.  He is good with other dogs his age, but may be better suited to a home without small children.

Rhett is a beautiful male Redbone hound who our vet believes is 5-6 years old.  This sweet fellow was found in a rural southern VA county as a stray and was totally emaciated, having been on his own for some time, most likely.  Since coming to CARE we have helped him to put on weight and feel loved.  He is a very nice dog who is looking for a family willing to share their home and hearts.

Rhett is in otherwise good health.  He has been given all his vaccines and has had blood tests.  We are very excited to share that he tested negative for heartworms!  He did test positive for erlichia and lyme, both spread by ticks, and we have provided treatment for both.  Rhett will be neutered and microchipped as a part of our adoption process.  He will make a wonderful addition to most any home!

Garrett is a beautiful male Jack Russell terrier mix that came to us from a rural southwestern Virginia shelter.  He is a three year old fellow who weighs just under 30 pounds.  Garrett is vision impaired, and may be unable to see at all.  He is a smart guy, however, and can walk up and down staircases and get around pretty well on a leash.

Garrett loves people and he loves other dogs.  A home with another kind pet would be such a blessing to him.  He is a quiet and cooperative, and deserves to be someone's cherished pet.  Garrett is in good health.  He is neutered and microchipped, up to date with all vaccines and on heartworm prevention.

Sweet Benji had a rough start in life but that's all changed now.  This sweetheart loves people and other dogs. Benji is housetrained.  Benji is very relaxed and easy going.  He loves to be petted and snuggles right up to your side. Benji does fine on walks and car rides.  He enjoys food and treats. 

He's on a high end dog food mixed with a little omega oil.  Benji would do great in most home settings.    CHR rescued Benji from the shelter.  He was taken away from his owners and considered a neglect case.  The only real issue Benji has is he doesn't like being groomed.  

We found that having him sedated with medications at the time of his grooming helps.  We have a special groomer located in Springfield, VA who is experienced in grooming dogs who hate being groomed.  Keeping Benji in a shorter cut is ideal to keep things simple and easy going.

Ralph is all hound. His best hound buddy, Benny, and he are quite the pair who love to play and romp around our fenced in fields and chase birds together. 

Ralph is about 5 yrs old, 60+ lbs and once his place in the pack is established without a lot of confusion, he is the most loyal, loving, kind dog and will do whatever you ask. He is a protector of his pack. 

Ralph is more laid back but once he decides to get into his zoomies, he creates much laughter for anyone watching...and toys? He can take them or leave them but if he takes them....that too is VERY funny to watch as he just has a blast with himself!

Ralph is very food motivated but knows his \""wait\"" commands!

Both girls are very sweet and playful and are pretty quiet for dachshunds!  They can be a little mischievous when outside and will try and dig under a fence.  Once you call them they will stop and will come to you.   They are avid lizard chasers and catchers so they do enjoy having a fenced in yard to play in.  

They are a bonded pair and love to snuggle together.  They are very easy going and will make a great addition to a family!

We are listing him to help with his rehoming as a courtesy to his current owners.

If you are interested in finding out more about him, please contact the person listed at the end of the following set of notes (provided by his owner, Kenny):

His name is Yeti and his information is below:

1. He is 5 and his birthday is in November. He weighs about 65lbs.
2. He is Neutered. When I brought him back from South Korea, the Korean government required him to be neutered in Order to export him.
3. He is up to date on vaccinations as of May of this year.
4. He is not treated monthly for anything, as none of those are currently in my area and there are no signs of anything.
5. No known issues. Last Vet check was beginning of 2018 when I moved from Vegas to northern Reno.
6. He behaves normally around all. He doesnât like to be âtrapped/blockedâ in. I currently have him around my 2 other dogs whom my ex wife is taking. He is also around other animals from my ex wifeâs mom.
7. Normal routine consists of pretty much outside all day. I live on 40 acres and he runs around it all. He exercises outside all day with the other dogs. He only eats once a day, and it is currently at night around 2000 hours.
8. He is both an inside and outside dog. Does great with both.
9. He knows sit, down, come. He pulls slightly on a leash, but nothing over the top. When he sees other dogs, he is just curious. Wants to smell and normal stuff dogs do.
10. He likes to be pet and loved. The only sensitive part is his tail. When we found him in Korea, he had a rubber band around his tail. The doctors had to cut it to make it healthy. That is the only part about him that is sensitive. You can see it in the photos.
11. He rides in cars fine. Back of trucks too. He hates the vet. Doesnât like to get shots, but it is possible. Can be lifted. Just marks his territory a lot.
12. He has not bitten anybody or any other animals that I am aware of. I just came back from overseas after a year, and my ex wife didnât say anything.
13. No separation anxiety or behavioral issues that I know of. He is kennel trained and dog door trained.
14. I adopted Yeti while I was stationed in Korea. I rescued him from a meat market. He has had all American veterinary care in Korea and well as in the states. Up to date on all shots. The reason Iâm rehoming him is because I got divorced right before my deployment and now that I am back, with the divorce and child support, I can no longer keep a place that can an animal can accompany me. I have to downsize my current lifestyle and living expenses in order to keep my head above water. I have had Yeti since 2014 when he turned 1.
15. I have not contacted any other rescues as of this moment.
16. Best method of contact is 702.823.9275 or kenny032004@gmail.com
17. Address: Reno NV, 89510."

Gaby is friendly with people of all ages and would be appropriate for very young children due to his calm nature. (Yes, he takes treats gently from hand.)

Gaby is great with other dogs and very playful with select dogs. His foster caretaker has four other dogs and Gaby rough houses constantly with the one female dog. However,  Gaby does prefer hanging out w/ his foster caretaker. See a video of Gaby interacting with  a few other dogs at GSRSV's rescue ranch elsewhere on this page.

We have not seen Gaby around cats but my hunch is that he'd be OK with them. We'll consider a home with cats for Gaby.

Gaby is fully housetrained and very well-behaved inside. He's never had an accident indoors even though it's likely he was kept as an outside dog previously. Gaby does not know  even the \""sit\"" command, but I was able to get him to sit in just a minute or so with a biscuit as incentive. Oh--Gaby loves treats, so he'll likely be very easy to train. 

Gaby is good on leash and has great recall off-leash. He does not wander far when off-leash. He rides well in a car; in fact, Gaby LOVES to go for car rides!  

Gaby showed up at an RV park/marina along the Sacramento River in June. All efforts to find his owner failed so the man who found him (a friend of GSRSV's) offered to foster him until we could find him a home.

Gaby is located in Verona (small town along the Sacramento River in south Sutter County). His adoption fee is $210."

and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Honey is a real sweetheart and a happy dog although a little confused right now. Honey has had a rough start in life and has bounced from place to place. Honey is looking for a family that can work with her to teach her the greatest way to be a dog and be loved. She does not have a mean bone in her body and loves everyone, except cats. Honey lived in a home with kids 4 and 6 and therefore, approved for kids 4 and up. The owner reports that Honey is very gentle with children. She is good with other dogs, but not cats. She has not had any training and will come with a training addendum. Honey is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. To avoid this, for now we are limiting placement to stand alone single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and send out an update.

Dodge's Doggerings:
Hi everyone, my name is Dodge. I made it into my foster home after a 2-hour ride. I traveled well even with all my pent-up energy from being at the vet! I'm good with dogs and have met the gang here. I can be a little exuberant in my greeting but I am being given correction; especially by Belle (the lemon beagle). It seems I hadn't had a lot of exposure to other animals so I'm unknown with cats. I'm healthy and up-to-date on everything. I love playing with toys and FM played toss with me today. I would bring it back to her, but I preferred to keep the toy. I know how to \""sit\"" when asked, but my butt doesn't always stay there. FM says that I still need to adjust to being here and she knows I will shine!
Love,
Dodge

She weighs 44 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Gracie is a happy but shy girl, who loves adorably once she trusts you, but will take a bit of time and some caution to earn that trust. She absolutely loves other dogs, and has never met one she doesn't like. For this girl, the more dogs in her world, the better. If you are giving affection to another dog, her curiosity will get the better of her and she'll almost immediately come up to investigate. She can be a bit hand shy, even once she trusts you, so just needs humans that will go slow and understand to give her time. When she's in her element, she is silly, rolling on the grass, spinning around and zooming as fast as she can to play \""tag\"" with the other dogs. And she's REALLY fast. She enjoys napping on the couch, and will allow herself to be a pillow for the other dogs. She also likes to sleep in bed with her humans and is incredibly silly in the mornings as she considers the bed a safe zone - she'll roll on her back and beg for belly rubs and play bitey-face. She especially loves when the other dogs join in the fun. She's excellent in the crate, and foster mom has spied her sleeping in the crate belly up while she's at work. Gracie prefers to eat alone, and will quickly eat her meals in her crate, or in a separate room, but is nervous eating in front of humans, unless it's people food that you are sharing with her (which she loves!). Her leash skills are pretty good, but she would prefer walking on quiet streets and not on a busy road. Gracie is a shy dog, and is always going to be a bit shy. She warms up to new people, but prefers them in small groups and not making a lot of noise, please. She's not the dog for you if you have rambunctious teenagers (or adults), throw parties often, or if you're looking for a dog to take everywhere with you. She started her life sheltered in a pen, and didn't get the socialization with humans she should have at an early age, so they make her a bit nervous. She's incredibly sweet and loving, and will reward you with her sweet, happy, silly self if you give her love, patience and understanding.

To avoid this, for now we are limiting placement to stand alone single-family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and send out an update. 

This dog is available for adoption from Lab Rescue LRCP.   Lab Rescue LRCP rescues and places dogs in Maryland,  Virginia, Washington DC, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina.  Adopters must travel to Maryland, or Virginia with their family - human and canine - to meet the dog they want to adopt.

She weighs 81 pounds but needs to lose about 5 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Kayla is a happy chocolate girl who likes belly rubs and running in the yard. She has been a loving and attentive mommy to multiple litters of puppies and now she is ready to take her turn in the spotlight. Sheâs a friendly girl with lots of energy who would do best with a family that will give her plenty of playtime outside, long walks, and lots of love. Kayla is good with dogs, but not cats and approved for kids 10 and up. Kayla is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. To avoid this, for now we are limiting placement to stand alone single-family homes or townhomes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and send out an update. 

Foster family reports: Kayla has a vivacious, energetic personality. After spending much of her life outdoors, she is excited to be in her foster home. Her tail has not stopped wagging! She thinks she's a lap dog and would crawl in your lap with the slightest encouragement. She introduced herself to the resident lab with play bows and ran zoomies with him. She is friendly without being either dominant or submissive. Kayla had no problem navigating the hardwood floors. She can zoom up and down stairs. She likes watching TV, especially animal shows and Litter Robot advertisements, which bring her to her feet everytime. (Must be the cat!) She also enjoys watching squirrels outside. This former breeder girl had a litter quite recently and still has enlarged mammaries. She weighs 80 lbs but should weigh ~75. She shows interest in meeting children (approved age 10+). Kayla rode well in the car and walks nicely in an Easy Walk harness. She loved her first walk in the park. Although she came from a rural area, she does not seem bothered by traffic or loud noises. Kayla is food motivated, which should help with refreshing commands. Kayla is settling nicely into her foster home. She was a little over-amped when she first arrived but now she is able to settle in the house. She enjoys playing with the resident lab, and in fact, she is usually the initiator of play! She likes taking walks around the neighborhood, and we discovered that she is a retriever. Kayla did not appear to know her name or any commands, so we are working to teach her basic commands and leash skills. She walks pretty well with an EZ-Walk harness, doesn't pull, but will sniff a lot if you let her. She needs to be tethered in the car until she knows her commands or she will be in the driver's lap. She is not crated when we leave the house and she does not disturb anything. Kayla is super loving and affectionate. She has all the most desirable lab traits! She is a velcro dog to foster mom, but seems to do most of her lab leans on the men she meets. She has met the neighbors and their dogs and impressed them with her friendliness and beauty. Other dogs really like her, so she appears to share good vibes! We don't know yet whether she likes water. Her background continues to mystify us. She was photographed at intake living on a chain, but she also knows her way around a house, is interested in human food and would like to get up on the furniture (although not allowed by her current foster). Kayla is quite energetic for her age and will need regular walks and/or active time in the yard. Since she doesn't bark, navigates stairs easily and can be exercised on leash, Kayla is now approved for townhouses on a case-by-case basis.

Bella #12 weighs 103 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Bella #12 is a chunky, curly coated chocolate girl who used to live on a farm with 2 other labs and an indoor cat. Even though leash walking is new, she is starting to grasp the idea. She is a pretty strong gal, so an EasyWalk harness makes all the difference in the world. Bella isnât all that much into toys, but she does love to play and swim in the water. She isnât used to spending long hours alone, but hasnât shown any anxiety when left alone at her foster home. She is quiet and submissive but will bark once or twice at new people or dogs. Bella is not destructive at all and is housebroken. She has not been crated for the last 6 years or so. She does enjoy sleeping on the couch during the day and in the bedroom at night. Bella enjoys her car rides and never has to be asked twice to get in the car. 

UPDATE from Bellaâs foster family:  Bella is adorable. So sweet, completely housebroken, sleeps all night. She LOVES to go on walks. She gets so excited jumping up & down on her front feet! She's very smart & knows commands.. sit, shake, down, stay & wait. She's very good at stay! She will play with a toy for a while and she always meet me at the door with a toy in her mouth when I come home. I do not crate her and she's fine. She has not gotten into anything or torn anything up. She's pretty good on a leash but could use some more leash training because she is strong and used to being off leash on the farm. We are working on her diet and exercise regime!

She weighs 34 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Louise is an adorable, petite, and quiet girl who came from a hoarding situation. She is looking for a family to make her feel special and loved. She rode quietly in a crate in the car. She spent many months in a temporary foster home in WV and she is used to living with other dogs, so she will need to go to a home with another dog. She is good with dogs, unknown with cats, and approved for kids 10 and up. Louise is sweet, docile, and affectionate. She barks very little and she hasnât had any accidents inside the house. She always goes outside to do her business and is very good on a leash. Louise is still a little shy around new people; just a few pets from the right person will capture her heart and she will capture theirs. 

Foster family reports:  Louise (âLuluâ) is slowing coming out of her shell. Watching and helping her learn about the sweetness of life has been amazing. Lulu has been pretty clear about her likes and dislikes. She dislikes noise and unpredictability. She loves food (especially chicken!), chilling in a quiet space, walks on quiet paths, dog toys, and calm human and canine company. She plays with her foster brother and approaches dogs on walks with confidence. Sweet Lulu is house- and crate-trained, very quiet, and as gentle as they come. She asks for nothing but a patient family with a dog that will continue to pamper her and appreciate the joy of seeing this girl blossom.

Candi weighs 31 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Candi is a very sweet and friendly pup. She got pregnant when she was about 7 months old, probably just after her first heat, and was an excellent mother to her puppies Claire & Brianna. Now that the pups have been adopted it is time for Candi to find her forever home. She has nice house manners and has free run of the house. At night she sleeps on a dog bed in the bedroom. Like all young, active dogs, she will need some additional training. Candi gets along fine with the resident dog and visiting dogs too. She enjoys plundering the toy chest. If you are sitting on the couch, she will join you to be close. She likes everyone she meets.

PLEASE VISIT THIS WEBSITE TO FIND THE ADOPTION QUESTIONNAIRE: http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-forms/ Hi there! My name is Lady (I am also called Lincoln but I have no idea why). I was rescued from a seizure case in rural Virginia and now I need a forever home! I am petite - about 20 inches tall and weigh about 20 lbs. I am about 4 years old and have been spayed. Maybe I am part Shibu Inu, Feist, or Mountain Cur or ????. I am a little shy and can be anxious when around new people and larger crowds. When I am inside and get to know you I relax and love to sit in your lap! People seem to like the fact that I am quiet and seldom feel the need to bark. I was adopted and returned to Homeward Trails, because I escaped first over a five-foot fence, and then another time I slipped out of my harness. I now have an industrial strength harness for walks. I guess I deserve it! I do like car rides, am housetrained, and I am waiting to give you a lot of love if you can help build my confidence and love me in return. My adoption fee is $375 and my adoption coordinator is MJ Crain. Please fill out an adoption questionnaire and email MJ at mj@mjcrain.com if you might be my forever home. Note from MJ: Lincoln needs some help with socialization. She is shy and can be and anxious when she is around new people and larger crowds.

Rose weighs 60 pounds and is up to date on shots. She is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Rose is a very sweet and loving girl. She had a rough life and is very happy that lab rescue brought her in and especially to her fosters. She plays very well with the resident lab, sleeps on the couch with foster dad and cuddles on the couch with resident lab when play time is over. She has the best soulful eyes that are just screaming. THANK YOU! 

Rose is great with dogs and people but cats and kids are unknown. Therefore, approved for kids 10 and older. During Rose's exam, the vet noticed a lump in her throat. They asperated the lump and sadly she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. She is not in any pain and unfortunately it is inoperable. She is not showing symptoms of being sick and continues to go about her day, playing with the other dogs, following foster mom around, snuggling on the couch, and constantly being spoiled. Sadly, Rose is considered to be in hospice right now.

Gunner has been examined and appears to be in good health.  That said, he has tested positive for heart worms.  We have begun a slow kill treatment, and he will be neutered as a part of our adoption process.  Gunner has received vaccines and has been microchipped.

He has done well in his crate when alone during the day and sleeps in bed with the teenage daughter at night without problem. He gets along well with other dogs he encounters on walks. He does pull a little at squirrels, but he is not bad at all.

Regina is a very sweet and slightly shy girl. She is a bit slow to warm up to people but once she does she will show you just how sweet she is. She play bows and wiggles her entire body when she sees foster mom. Once she is comfortable with you she will surprise you by stealing kisses when she can. She would benefit most in a somewhat quieter household and a patient one so she can blossom at a more relaxed pace.  Regina gave birth to a rainbow of girls 8 weeks ago. Now that the girls are weaned she is looking for her fur-ever home. All of Regina's puppies have been adopted, and Regina has adjusted very well to life without little ones. She sleeps in a dog bed in the master bedroom. She loves to chase toys and will toss them up into the air with joy. She now tries to engage the resident dogs in play with lots of play bows and quick dashes away. She still LOVES to be outside as much as possible. Currently, she refuses all treats and loses all interest in other activities when strangers are around (this is a change from just a few weeks ago when she settled down nicely with female guests). She continues to change and make progress each week, so it may be a phase that she works through quickly. Her adoptive family will need to be patient while she adjusts to the changes in her life. She still needs to gain a few pounds - she is a picky eater, but will happily munch a dose of Philadelphia cream cheese:).

Monkey is a happy and friendly dog. She enjoys being in the yard, but think she would be just as happy to be a couch potato and hang with you. Hasn't shown any interest in playing with toys yet. She sits nicely for treats and takes them gently. She does fine when she goes out to play in the yard with our other pups. Think she would be happy to be a couch potato and just hang with you. She would like a family that has a yard for her to play in to give her the exercise she needs. Misty is now at a fosters and is living with 3 other dogs without problems. Kids 10 and up as we have no history. Good with other dogs has been out in the yard with other Lab Rescue dogs with no problems. No cat history. Knows sit, down and come. Good on lead. Is house and crate trained as she is keeping her room clean at the kennel and at her fosters. Monkey is a very affectionate and loving pup. She enjoys walking and is calm and easy on leash. She gets a bit excited when she sees a squirrel. She enjoyed her bath. She is food-motivated and will come running anytime she hears a bag being opened. Monkey is from a rural area and have not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking.

As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and send out an update. 

Foster family reports: Monkey is sad because summer is almost over and she will not be able to wear her hat and shades anymore - she will have to shop for a scarf! She is a very good sport and is willing to sport attire to entertain her foster family. Her foster dad took her to Petco and she did great. She enjoyed the yummy smells and seeing all the other dogs. Monkey says hello and wants to share that she is a very calm and well behaved pup! She loves to lay around with her foster parents and the resident dogs. She likes to relax and loves rolling on her back and wriggling around so her tummy can be scratched. Monkey is very obedient and knows basic commands, such as sit and stay. She likes taking walks with her foster family and sitting outside on the deck, watching the world go by. She definitely watches for the rabbits to zoom past! Monkey's foster mom took her to Starbucks for a Puppercino and she loved it!

Chops weighs 55 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Chops came to us as a very scared pup, but his foster has been working very hard to socialize him and let him know that people and the world are not so bad. He has been building his confidence a little at a time. He is good with dogs but is still a puppy at heart, so can be a little annoying to the older, less playful dogs. He has become much more attentive to people and has started to show more affection and enjoy human contact more. His foster has been working with the collar and leash, but he still sometimes \""gator rolls\"" when the leash goes on so a fenced yard is a must for him. 

Chopâs perfect adopter would be: 
1) A home with less chaos and a family that is willing to show patience and continue to help him grow and learn. 
2) A home with another dog to help him with confidence. 
3) Someone willing to possibly \""visit\"" with him a few times before taking him home

He does have a few quirks which training should easily correct:  placing his paws on your shoulders while seated on the couch, thinking you want to continue playing after he \""releases\"" a toy or bone, barking at strangers at the door until he gets to meet them (he remembers them on subsequent visits so that is pretty handy). He does not have an aggressive bone in his body. Buddy is trustworthy alone at home and is not crated at night. Buddy is a great little guy!

After retiring from her demanding hunting job in rural West Virginia, Charlotte is happy to kick back and relax in the Virginia Country side.  She has learned to appreciate the finer things in life like a warm fluffy bed, a full belly, and lots of fun walks.  Since her arrival, Charlotte has learned to walk beautifully on a leash.  She enjoys going on walks so much that we would prefer to adopt her to a family that would enjoy taking her for frequent, long walks. Charlotte is still new to indoor life and may need some guidance when she first goes to a new home.

Jax is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people, so Jax is approved for placement to stand alone single-family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area for now. 

Jax's teacher was grateful that he was such a good student. Because he grew up in a pen with his siblings and wasn't exposed to a lot of things, he can be a bit timid when you first meet, but he has a lovely disposition and warms up quickly. He enjoys the outdoors and taking hikes. He loves to run around the yard and will need to go to a family with a physical fence. Jax needs a family who will not leave him alone for a long work day. He is used to being with other dogs and loves their company. After he gets the right amount of exercise, he settles down for a nap. He doesn't like to be crated much, so that is a work in progress and he can stay for short periods with a frozen kong, or a favorite durable toy. This young boy has already proven that with the right amount of exercise and continued obedience training, he will be an amazing companion for someone who puts in the time. He comes with a complimentary 7-week Good Manners class at Peaceable Paws in Fairplay, MD. He is excited to find a forever home with a doggy buddy:) 

UPDATE FROM THE FOSTER: This sweet boy is very gentle and loving. He wants to be with companions, both canine and human. Jax has excellent leash manners, loves walks and is learning to go for runs with his foster brother. Jax loves being with other pups (the more the merrier!) and people. Nothing beats a good cuddle session after a full day of play - check out his snuggle with the resident black lab in the photos. If you like exciting outdoor adventures followed by late afternoon naps in the sunny spot, Jax is a perfect match. Jax had fun where he got to run on the trail, wrestle with the other dogs, and play with the humans. He squeezed in a nap in the sunny spot, beating the other pups to it. He loves to meet new people and dogs and play, play, play. This pup is full of joy and energy, and would love a family to share it with him!

Drake is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people, so Drake is approved for placement to stand alone single-family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area for now. 

Drake is a stunning black adorable male. He is doing great and loves his people! Drake thinks that he is the top dog and no one can come close to his looks therefore he is not a fan of other dogs so, he will need a home with no other dogs in the home so he can be the lone supermodel. He is affectionate and sweet but, will need someone to stand firm on the rules of the house. He is house and crate trained and knows all of his basic commands.Â Drake is a sweet and awesomely happy boy! Heâs a big, beautiful, block-headed dog that just wants to be in your lap. Drake knows sit and shake and appears to be crate trained. He slept quietly all night in his crate. Drake likes to retrieve. 

UPDATE FROM THE FOSTER: Drake is play time all day, and he has a full-on body wag! Handsome blockhead black lab, who is toy-obsessed and just wants to have fun. He loves attention and is doing well in training and with doggie day care. He is great with his people. Has a killer lab-lean and is very affectionate once he gets to know you. Drake is fine walking past other dogs on leash, but has no interest in engaging them to play. He is great with people but, not a fan of other dogs so, he needs to be the only dog in the household. Drake is learning his commands and loves human attention. Drake is full of life, and a huge fan of toys and tennis balls - he will even entertain himself. He needs to loose a few pounds, but playing fetch daily in the yard should definitely help him along with his weight-watchers program. He is a big fan of people and lots of fun. You won't regret giving this boy his forever home!  Drake is such an happy camper and so excited about life he rarely stands still - even when trying to get a picture to show the world how gorgeous he is. He's got the classic big blocky head and thick otter tail. He is not the most cuddly until you take him on an 8 mile hike - maybe after that he will snuggle of the couch. Drake thinks there is a lot to life and he is ready to see it all!!

I'm Sheba. I was picked up as a stray in Texas in July and brought to my foster home at the end of October. I am spayed and have never been pregnant so I was likely not a stray for very long. I am heartworm positive, but will he treated by SSR

I had an interesting first 24 hours with my new foster dad. He picked me up from the nice ladies who drove me all the way from Texas to Virginia and took me straight to a place where I got a bath. I was very good for my bath and allowed him to do all the things that he had to do to get me \""clean\"". I thought I was just fine the way I was but the warm water was nice. I then met the 2 owners of the house, Duke who is a German Shepherd like me and Lily who is a Border Collie mix. They smelled Ok, I guess. I did not pay too much attention to them. I then had a look around the house. While I was doing that my foster dad got some food for me which I ate really quickly. He says I am \""overly enthusiastic\"" when I eat and I try to see what is on the kitchen counters a lot, but I am just really hungry and it is hard to get over not knowing when your next meal will be. I slept in a crate all night and was so tired, I did not fuss at all.

I then went for a walk around the block. It was a nice walk and I just followed my foster dad. I don't usually pull on the leash but sometimes when I see a squirrel or fox or deer I want to chase them. I don't try too hard to do that because my leash and collar stop me and I don't want to pull too hard.

In the morning I went to the vet. I was very good for the doctor and let her do all the things she needed to. I did not complain at all.

I sometimes chase my tail and chew on it. I also have a bit of a hotspot on my back but that is clearing up. We are going to ask about my tail, though. I have chewed through much of the hair there.

I always like to be with my foster dad but sometimes he puts me in a crate. That is ok but I don't like it when I hear him but can't be with him. I try and jump around in my crate and make noises so he will come get me out. If he does not then I will stop after 5 minutes or so. I am good with being in my crate at night and when he goes out, though.

I understand a few of the words dad uses to ask me to do things. I know sit, stay (although for these I usually will expect a treat at some point), and come. There are others but he has not figured them out and I am surely not going to tell him what they are. Gotta make him work for it. I have gotten along well with my foster brother and sister so far. I have met dogs when we walk and they have seemed nice. I am not sure how I feel about cats but if they run I will chase them so dad does not think I would be good with them.

A couple of days after I got to Virginia there was something called Halloween. Not sure what that was but dad and I sat outside while a bunch of strange small people came up to the house. Dad said I was very well behaved and I let a lot of them pet me. There were some really small ones, too.

My foster dad tells me I am nice to have around and once I figure out that I will never have to worry about eating so I am not so enthusiastic about my food (and treats) and stop counter surfing, I will be a really awesome family member.

Rulcho weighs 55 pounds and is up to date on shots. He is approved for homes with children 10 and up.

Foster update:  Rulcho has really blossomed in his foster! He has become much more confident and outgoing. He loves other dogs, especially Blondie :-) He loves toys and really loves food puzzles. He has done great with meeting new people. He is great in the crate and good on leash. He would love a quiet home with a confident owner and a doggie friend would be ideal! 

Rulcho is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. For now, to avoid this, we are limiting placement to standalone, single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. After Rulcho has been in a foster home for at least a week or two, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and will send out an update.

These dogs are a bonded pair who must be adopted together.  They are approved for homes and townhomes with children ages 10 and up.

Foster update:  Smokey and Princess are a bonded brother and sister pair, ready to face whatever life sends their way! Life sent this precious pair a curve ball when their owner could no longer care for them. Now theyâre hoping Lab Rescue will send them a family who can appreciate the bounty of benefits that come with adding a senior (or 2) to your family: loving, laid back, house trained, donât need tons of exercise, gentle with kids, off the charts adorable frosted faces! These sweet seniors would be an easy addition to any family. 

Princess and Smokey here! Foster mom went on vacation so we did too! Now we're back and time to unpack our tennis balls. We had a great time at our vacation foster home. We got to go to some neighborhood parties and we even helped supervise a litter of foster puppies that came for a short visit. Our favorite part of the vacation was the teenagers! They would rub our ears and scratch our bellies and throw tennis balls for us in the yard! Sometimes we had to wait until lunchtime for them to wake up, but they were really fun to play with. We're happy to be back with foster mom, but we're still hoping that someone out there has a permanent place in their heart and their home for us. We are an easy pair that just continues to demonstrate how adaptable and easy going we are. From 10 days living in a hotel to 3 weeks with a vacation foster, we make ourselves at home and adapt to new people and places easily. All we need is a yard with some tennis balls and some people to love and snuggle!

Toby weighs 76 pounds and is up to date on shots. He is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Toby needs to spend his senior years with a family that will love and care for him every day. They will get a truly grateful, loving dog, perfect for taking along on adventures because his loyalty and loving personality will put smiles on any family that calls him theirs. 

Foster update:  Toby is a total sweetheart! He loves hanging out with his humans and is quite willing to be loved on:) He does well with the senior resident lab and enjoys their walks, trotting along side-by-side. He is more energetic than expected for his age and would enjoy long walks or a light run. Toby is not a fan of the crate, but that is okay because he can be trusted to have the run of the house. He does not care to be separated from his people when they are home (what lab does?!). 

Toby is approved for kids 7 and up, he previously lived with a boy and a girl and he loved to be with them. He is good with other dogs but no cats as he will chase them. Toby knows sit, shake, fetch and laydown. He pulls some on lead and would benefit from an Easy Walk harness. He is crate trained and has been keeping his room clean at the kennel.  He is also trained to an invisible fence. 

Toby is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. To avoid this, for now we are limiting placement to stand alone single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and send out an update. 

Toby is Heartworm Positive. Heartworm is highly treatable and treatment will be provided, at no cost to the adopter, at one of Lab Rescue's designated vets. Completing Heartworm treatment at the veterinarian designated by the Rescue is a requirement of adoption. Adopters can learn more about Heartworm at www.lab-rescue.org/heartworm.

Scout weighs 50 pounds and is up to date on shots. He is approved for homes with children ages 15 and up.

Foster update:  Scout is a shy sweetheart who is getting used to life in the city. He rode like a dream for the long drive from the vet to his foster. He is doing fine in a townhouse and learned to negotiate the stairs. He isnât crazy about being put in his crate, but he will quiet down quickly and is content to sleep there. Scout doesnât pull on his leash unless he spies a squirrel or rabbit and he seems okay with traffic noises. He ignores the cat. 

Scout loves to be near to his people and wants to have his foster in sight at all times, or better yet, snooze beside her on the couch. He needs a calm home and adopters that will be patient as he learns more about the world! Scout needs to gain confidence but he is so eager to please and is a real love bug! Scout takes a few minutes to warm up but, if you get down on the ground and let him come to you - he will warm up and snuggle. He loves treats. He will need an experienced owner who will continue with his training to teach him that life can be fun!

Pepe is a fantastic lap dog with a soft shiny coat! He gives the sweetest kisses and loves to snuggle. This little guy is super smart and has learned some new tricks including up, spin, and paw. He loves to show off his skills in exchange for treats and praise, and he is always eager to learn more. 

Foster update: Pepe has only been with us for the last 3 days, but he is a wonderful guest. His favorite thing to do is just cuddle with you on the couch. Second favorite is working on a bone, but he will put it down in a moment if someone comes into the room. Pepe doesnât touch a thing that doesnât belong to him and is housebroken to the max. He is crated for a couple hours a couple times a week to stay in practice, but there is really no reason to keep him crated- he would be a great buddy for someone who does work a full day since he can easily entertain himself. The most he barks is a single âWoofâ to tell the crazy dogs to go play elsewhere. He is a couch potato who insists on sleeping with his babies, which he sometimes carries around. Pepe is gentle with treats and stretches out a meal until the next one. He is great in the car, just occasionally panting. Pepe is also well behaved on leash and is doing fine behind a 4â fence.

Pokie weighs 61 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Pokie is an exceptionally loving, sweet boy that adores all people and his toys. This silly boy has a toy on him at all times - so much so that we've had to teach him to check his toy at the door before he goes outside. Pokie has exceptional house manners. He is fully house trained and has full run of the house while we're out. He also loves going for rides in the car. Pokie is quiet and only lets out an occasional bark when there's someone at the door. Pokie is partially blind due to complications from diabetes, but he does see shadows and gets around just fine. He loves running around the yard and playing ball (he listens for the bounce and is quite good at locating it). His diabetes is well controlled with two injections a day that are quite easy to do. Pokie's other passion is food and he equates getting his insulin with a biscuit, so he eagerly sits in anticipation of getting his injection and treat. He would do well as an only dog or have a laid back doggy companion. No kitties. Pokie has so much love to give his forever family. He is such a sweet gentleman, LOVES people, toys and catching some rays. Pokie is mostly blind due to diabetes, but runs full speed around the house. He has excellent house manners and is a complete sweetheart. Pokie would do great as an only dog or with another super laid back companion. 

Foster family reports: Pokie is a wonderful companion. He loves to play with people and is getting along with the pack. Pokie adores everyone he meets and is very affectionate. Pokie loves to play ball (he tracks very well with his hearing). He is perfect in the house - he has never had an accident or gotten into anything he shouldnât. His thyroid and diabetes management have remained very stable. He would probably do best with a quiet doggy sibling or on his own.

I know itâs been awhile so I thought Iâd let you know how Iâm doing here in my foster home. Itâs been great. We had a nice Christmas and foster mom was very impressed that I didnât try to potty on the tree. Really mom??? I know better than that. All my business is done outside.
I have been a very good boy. I now have run of the house and only go into my crate when I want to, not because I have to. I like to follow my foster dad. He is my buddy. He calls me his shadow. Guess that is a good thing. I only bark when I see something outside or my foster sisters bark. Iâm a pretty quiet guy. And I still love my belly rubs!
My foster sisters are fun to have around. Buttercup and I play in the yard and I help Violet track rabbits. Thatâs not as much fun as playing. 
As much as I am having fun here, what I really would like is a home of my own. I know my forever home is out there. If you meet me, I know you will just fall in love with me. Iâm that kind of a guy. 





UPDATE - 23 OCTOBER 2018: Hey there, Iâm Maui. And I just have to tell you that I love being in a home!! I have been with my foster family for over a week. I have a real cool Mom and Dad and 2 awesome sisters. I have several warm and comfy beds to choose from. Or on occasion, I may curl up on a chair. I get 2 meals a day and a yard to run around in. Life is good!! Especially when I get belly rubs, which I ask for often. I will roll over on my side or back and Mom will rub my belly. She thinks itâs cute.

My Mom says that I am a good boy. I do all my business outside and I keep my crate clean and dry during the day. I enjoy running in the yard with my sister. And we like to play and rough house. Itâs so much fun.

Now donât get me wrong, I really like it here. But what would really be even better is if I had a forever home of my own. That would make my life perfect.
 So if you are looking for a fun loving, easy going good boy, check me out. I wonât disappoint.

Garrett is vision impaired, and may be unable to see at all.  He is a smart guy, however, and can walk up and down staircases and get around pretty well on a leash.

Garrett loves people and he loves other dogs.  A home with another kind pet would be such a blessing to him.  He is a quiet and cooperative, and deserves to be someone's cherished pet.  Garrett is in good health.  He is neutered and microchipped, up to date with all vaccines and on heartworm prevention.

Dagwood is a super sweet boy! When he first came to us he was very scared and timid. He has really come out of his shell and he loves people! He is still leery of other dogs, mostly those that are \""in your face\"" type dogs. He does well with dogs that just coexist with him and do not try to initiate too much. He gets a little intimated if shown too much attention by another dog. Dagwood has lots of good points. He is good on leash and loves to go on group walks. He is affectionate and well behaved. He is housebroken. He also presents his challenges. He is terrified of a crate and will try to break out. He is an escape artist with containment, possibly from his formative years of having to live in a pen with MANY other dogs. He would be best placed with someone who is home most of the time or where he could go with them a lot. We do not have any cat history on him and he is approved for kids 10 and up.

Baby weighs 30 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Baby is the most charming, sweetest little pup. She is fearless and loves everyone and everything. She especially adores water! When foster mom was cleaning and refilling the pup pools in the yard, Baby had so much fun chasing the water and carrying the hose. She loves to cuddle and will fall asleep on the couch snuggled up with the other dogs, or next to foster mom. She loves playing with the big dogs and does her very best to keep up with them. She's curious about everything and loves to explore. Baby was born with a neurological condition that affects her movement. She sometimes weaves or stumbles when walking, and needs to be watched near stairs. She is on a low dose of Prednisone and 5mg of Omeprazole once/day to prevent an upset stomach. But this delightful girl still approaches everything full of excitement and joy. She is looking for someone who has a huge heart and maybe a friendly resident dog that will be her buddy. If you have a place in your heart for this sweet, sweet girl, her love will reward you ten-fold.

UPDATE from Babyâs foster family:  Baby's favorite thing to do is play with other dogs and snuggle with them or her humans. She often is found sleeping belly up, as close as she can get to the other dogs or foster mom, and snoring... She loves the new dog bed that she can nuzzle up in as well. Baby is learning to use the ramp to go down the short grouping of stairs outside to the yard, and is getting better at it! She is also learning to go up the big staircase in the house and doing great! She has found her voice and foster mom affectionately refers to her as \""bossy\"" when she barks because she wants to do something and hasn't quite figured out how yet. She also likes to bark at the big dogs to get them to play bitey-face with her on the couch. She's a sweet, silly, special girl, who is looking for forever humans that understand her limitations and help her break down the walls when she can.

She weighs 95 pounds but needs to lose about 20 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 10 and up.

Marley is a very sweet girl. She would love to meet you so she can give you love and attention. She loves to be with you to play and get petted which I don't think she had a lot of until she came to us. She enjoys being outside playing with other dogs but thinks being inside with people is better. She is not interested in running around outside retrieving but will go get treats which she takes very nicely. She likes to go on walks which is good as she has to lose some extra weight. We see a vegetable and fruit diet in her future! Marley would like to meet a family that will give her love and attention. Kids 10 and up as we don't have history. Good with other dogs has been out with other LR pups at the kennel with no problems. No cat history. Knows sit, come and sometimes down. Not bad on lead, better when walking with an Easy Walk Harness. Crate trained, probably house trained as she is keeping her room clean at the kennel. If you are looking for a laid back, gentle soul, consider Marley. This dog is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. To avoid this, for now we are limiting placement to stand alone single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. As we learn more from the dog's time spent in foster, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded. 

Foster family reports: Update We know that Marley is not her real name so we're trying different names. Right now we're calling her Penny, so we'll see. A couple more facts about Marley/Penny. We're not sure how she got to be so large but she's the most food-unmotivated lab! She may or may not eat her breakfast and she's really not into fruits or veggies. Her thyroid has been tested and is fine. We've never had a pup take treats so gently. We're used to the \""you may lose your fingers\"" type of lab. Marley/Penny will go to the door if she needs to do her business. She would like a family who's willing to take the time with her to help her feel comfortable and loved. She'd also like a couple walks a day to help her build up her stamina and lose some of those pesky pounds. She recently visited with a friend for a weekend sleepover and met two very dog-savvy cats. She initially appeared to want to play with them but that was more effort than she wanted to expend and she laid back down. Marley/Penny found the toy basket, and although she is not a huge player or retriever, she periodically picks up a tennis ball and brings it to you or gnaws on one of the many bones all over the house. She LOVES her walks she doesn't go far and not too fast but she loves all the smells and all the people and dogs met so far. Marley/Penny is a very easy dog that requires little more than a place to sleep, a few pats on her head, some belly scratches and some food. Do you have room in your heart and home for Penny?

He has been fascinated by joggers and was completely mesmerized by a sprinkler. He has been very interested in everything the family is doing. He likes to lay in the kitchen while we are cooking and eating dinner, but never begs or gets into the garbage. Blake does not bark and does not jump on strangers. He has not had the opportunity to learn basic commands but has demonstrated he can learn quickly and responds when you correct him. He went from crazy dog on a leash to a calmer and responsive walker on the harness. Blake will make a great addition to a family and will quickly bond. He has loads of personality and has perfect house manners.

UPDATE from Blakeâs foster family:  Blake is a sweet, sweet boy and is doing great in his foster townhome. He is housebroken and has free reign over the house when his foster needs to be gone. He has not been crated; he did scratch at the door when left alone initially, but calmed after a couple of days. His foster works-from-home, so he does get a potty break every four hours. Blake is great with the fosterâs teenager. He knows sit, and he quickly learned paw! He is a great eater, is not protective of his food, and sleeps through the night. He gets excited when you first get home and tends to jump, but that is something that can be trained. Blake is a love bug and loves snuggling in your bed or the sofa - he would a family that will let him on the furniture:) 

Blake is a playful guy and walks ~4 miles each day to expend his energy. He is very strong, and his handler needs to be prepared for him to pull hard if he senses something he wants to investigate. He is learning to walk on a leash and doing MUCH better, but ongoing training is needed. He wants to meet people and dogs on his walks and does well; he has not spent time alone with other pups while with his fosters. Blake is a cuddly, fun-loving boy and is the perfect match for a family willing to give him the exercise and ongoing training he needs. 

Blake is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people. If dogs are overwhelmed by their environment, they can exhibit behaviors like excessive barking. For now, to avoid this, we are limiting placement to standalone, single family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area. After Blake has been in a foster home for at least a week or two, we will evaluate if placement can be expanded to include a more urban environment and will send out an update. He has loads of personality and has perfect house manners.

Duke weighs 73 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 16 and up. Duke is from a rural area and has not been exposed to traffic, noise, or groups of people, so Duke is approved for placement to stand alone single-family homes in a suburban neighborhood or rural area for now. 

Duke is an adorable boy with a dark honey colored coat, a sweet sugar dipped muzzle, and gorgeous golden eyes. This lovable guy enjoys snuggling with his stuffies, riding in the car, and relaxing with his humans. He does well in his crate and doesn't mind sleeping in there at night. He is very friendly, but can take some time to warm up to new situations. Once he does, he's a happy boy with a tail that won't stop wagging. Duke knows basic commands and is crate/house trained. He does pull on leash so an easy walk harness is recommended. Duke is loving life at doggie day care. He is very loving and is having fun meeting new people and pups. He enjoys getting petted and has a great lab lean. :) He will actively seek attention from his people with a nose nudge. If you are sitting down, he will place his chin on your lap or put his nose under your hand to get affection. 

UPDATE FROM THE FOSTER: Duke is not shy at all. He is an in your face, happy-go-lucky, and go along all the time. He is a jumping bean (except he is BIG). He's full of energy, but happy to do anything for a treat or a toy! Duke loves all stuffiesâ¦ however, he loves to destroy them more. Do you have a lot of stuffies that need destroying? Duke is your guy.

Ginger weighs 72 pounds and is up to date on shots. This dog is approved for homes with children ages 8 and up.

Ginger is a sweet, smart, gentle lady who enjoys snuggling, swimming, and going for walks. This pretty brown-eyed girl has good manners in the house, sleeps all night in a cozy dog bed, knows multiple commands, and walks well on a leash. Sheâs pretty close to perfect! Ginger is a fun, active girl who doesnât need much and is ready to find a family that has room for a laid-back love bug in their lives. Sheâs generally fine to be left alone for about 6 hours, but she needs a home where she won't be alone for a long work day. There are just a few things Ginger canât do in her golden years - like stairs. Sheâs okay on a few, but a whole flight is too much for her. She also needs help getting into a car. Ginger LOVES to sleep in the bedroom. She gets along with all of the resident dogs, and even the resident cat. Sometimes she doesn't like to share her toys, so as long as there are plenty of toys to be had, she will be a happy camper! She has been learning to take treats gently and responds to \""easy.\"" She'll be a great addition to someone's home. She's such a nice dog with a great spirit and energy!Â 

UPDATE FROM FOSTER: Beautiful Ginger is checking in with a smile! Her foster family adores her and states that you cannot help but but smile and love her!! Ginger has great house manners, loves to go for walks, enjoys car-rides, is thrilled with lots of attention and will sleep quietly at your feet. All of these good things are wrapped up into a 13-year-old girl who is truly young in heart and spirit! Ginger is a gem of a gal who is always wagging her tail and is always excited to start her day, giving no thought or worry as to what will come her way -- A lesson to learn!! Ginger has so many good qualities and is good with other dogs who will respect her space - AND when she gets to know the kitty's in her life, she respects their space and won't chase or bother them. Ginger is not good on steps, but she has great house manners and knows all the basics. Added to this, she also has great eye-mouth coordination to catch treats, loves car-rides and lots of attention and of course mealtimes! All these good things wrapped up into a beautiful 13-year-old girl who is young in heart and spirit and has so much love to give!!

All dogs with PUP are in private foster homes so we can provide our potential adopters the most current information available.

Health:

Rosa

has been spayed and microchipped. She is current on her DHPP, Bordetella, and Rabies. She has been wormed and flea treated.

She has been tested for heart worm.

She has been diagnosed with recurrent struvite bladder crystals and requires a special diet.

History: Rosa comes from a local Washington shelter. PUP was asked to help and we are happy to help her find her forever home!

Notes from Rosa's Foster Home: If you are a fan of the chihuahua personality and spunk, then Rosa may be the pup for you! She has been delighting us since joining our home and we truly love this girl!

Rosa really enjoys getting out and about. She loves neighborhood walks as well as exploring a wooded trail. She is a 'regular' at Home Depot and has fun with her friends at the local pet food store. She can be shy when meeting people and likes to have an opportunity to meet new folks at her own pace. She would love to be your sidekick!

Rosa's house manners are excellent! She is crate trained, house trained on a schedule, and has mastered many commands. Rosa will alert bark at times but quiets quickly with correction. When not snoozing in a comfy dog bed, she is busy playing with toys, running and retrieving, or playing tug with our 75 lb dog (don't tell her she only weighs 7 lbs!). She can be quite comical when chasing squirrels in the yard, chasing a ball, or running in the yard for the sheer joy of it! Come evening, she looks for a warm and welcoming lap. She is just loaded with personality and this tiny-but-mighty dog makes us laugh every day. And did we mention her cute little zig-zag tail?

Rosa has 'bladder struvite crystals'. Crystals are concentrates of naturally occurring minerals in a dog's urine which can occur due to abnormal urine pH. The good thing about struvite crystals is they can be managed easily by keeping her on an inexpensive prescription food (approx $15/month). She needs to have water available at all times, as well as the opportunity to get outside frequently. Despite this diagnosis, Rosa behaves like all happy and playful young dogs.

Because of her size and shy nature, she will do best in a home with adults and older, dog-respectful children (12+ yrs) She also needs to have opportunities to go 'out' several times during the day. She loves other dogs and would really enjoy having a playful canine buddy in her new home or a playmate nearby. She will require strict adherence to her dietary needs.

This extra-special pup is looking forward to finding her new, extra-special family!

Note: The above description reflects the behavior we have observed in the dog's foster home. Although PUP provides adopters up to the minute information on our dogs, we cannot guarantee they will behave in the same manner in a different environment with new owners.

Tommy was a shelter favorite at his previous shelter - his goofy and affectionate personality won over everyone he met. He is social, active, and always down to play.

This boy has been through a lot, but he is the forgive and forget type - with his charming nature he makes friends easily. Tommy would do great with training based on positive reinforcement, he is highly motivated by food, attention and toys. Tommy needs to be the only pet in the home.

Desperate to find a experienced foster or home for this sweet American Bulldog Max

Max is a one of a kind dog. His story is a long one but worth the read. So...here it goes.

Max was dumped from a moving vehicle almost 5 years ago in the Enumclaw area of Washington. He wasnât injured and a Good Samaritan caught him and took him to regional animal services in Kent, WA.

Once at the shelter he did what a lot of pet dogs do in the busy shelter environment, he shut down. The shelter Sargent was very dedicated and searched for an rescue or home for him but he was getting worse as time passed and no one stepped up for him. 

The day before Thanksgiving, James Branson agreed to pull Max out of the shelter and do a search for his owners. He was placed in foster while this was done and once an owner wasnât identified he was placed up for adoption. 

But, he had some junk in his trunk, again not uncommon dogs of this breed. After a few months a home was identified and he was placed where he lived for a few years. His family was moving cross country and his âissuesâ had become pressing enough that they felt they could no longer provide a good home for him and so he was surrendered back to Useless Bay.  In the last two months Max has gotten a lot of training on board and become a very good canine citizen. 

Heâs now looking for his soft place to land. 

All about Max

Heâs 6-7 years old, UTD on shots, neuter, microchipped and trainer to work loose leash. He has a very nice level of training on board and is very level headed. 

Maxâs ideal home would have breed experience, be willing to work with some of his quirky behaviors and give him a happy forever after that he deserves.

He is a quiet, goofy, sweet guy who enjoys snuggling up in his crate, playing fetch and chewing on bones. Seymour is a smart boy and learns new commands and tricks very quickly. He is leash trained, crate trained, place trained and knows many commands including sit, down, shake, no, come and out. Seymour plays really well with other dogs off leash in his foster home and could benefit having a female canine companion or easy going male canine companion to keep him company throughout the day. He does wonderful with his foster fur-siblings and currently lives with dogs of all sizes. He loves to run and LOVES to play in the water but also is the first one to settle in at night. Seymour will make a great companion for a single person or couple that enjoys sticking close to home, hanging out in the back yard or watching netflix. Seymour also needs someone who is dedicated to continuing his training program in and around the home in order to get the very best out of him. Seymour recently accompanied his foster mom on a 7 day trip to Idaho and completed a shadow program with Method K-9 training. If you are looking for a dog with a great training foundation then Seymour is your man!

Over 3,500 days since the hurricane cracked the skies open and drove the sea right into town. If you have to ask which hurricane, well, then you probably aren't from around here. Katrina made landfall at Waveland, MS, a small town of 7,000 just an hour east of New Orleans, on August 29, 2005, and you'd be hard-pressed to find any of God's good creatures in Waveland that don't remember. Destin and Sparky remember.



Chaos is too simple of a word to convey what that time was like, but it's the closest thing we've got. Fortunately, there were a few clear minds that day, including Doll Stanley and In Defense of Animals. The organization recognized the doom bearing down on animals in the region, petitioning courts to release captured animals in the pound. Destin was one such animal, languishing in the pound as the storm bore down on the Gulf Coast. At the 11th hour, a judge granted the request, forcing animal control to release the animals to safety. When they reached Destin, the water was already up to her neck. Destin and 34 other animals were rescued that night, but, sadly, thousands more souls lost their lives all along the coast. Destin and Sparky, who was discovered after the storm, were some of the lucky ones.



A number of animal rescue facilities went to work in the aftermath of Katrina, and ARF was one of the organizations born from the rubble. The 35 dogs from Waveland made the trip north to Jackson, and a few more groups soon followed. Destin and Sparky were placed together in their new home, and quickly became inseparable, sharing a bond that few of us can scarcely imagine. Yet over 3,500 days after the storm arrived, these two remain with ARF. Every one of the other 35 dogs has moved on, either adopted to a wonderful home or crossing the rainbow bridge. We've twice attempted to adopt Sparky individually, but both dogs immediately grew depressed and stopped eating. Their bond is unique and irreplaceable, and so even though we know how challenging it is to adopt two older dogs, we know that they need to be together. They are sweet and spunky, despite their advanced age. But the wisdom in their eyes is surely enough reward for providing a forever home.



Katrina had an impact that still reverberates throughout the region. As we think of it, we still mourn for those that have been lost. Yet we also recognize the events that catalyzed the creation of ARF, and are reminded of our mission. If you can't adopt Destin and Sparky today, then please continue joining us in this mission.

There is no way to tell you about these girls affectionately known as âThe Mamasâ and keep it short, so thank you for reading the entire post. Mama Bear and Carol were rescued from the streets of West Nashville where they had been roaming with a local group of strays. It is estimated that between the two of them they had close to  40 puppies over 18 months. They did the best they could to take care of each other and all the puppies, which were often rescued by locals, but no one could ever catch âThe Mamasâ, they were shy, smart, cautious survivors. We were finally able to catch them in November 2015 and since then they have been in foster learning to be dogs. The have come a long way, but still have a ways to go before they are ânormal dogsâ. They are incredibly smart and have a lot of love to give, but will need an adopter that is willing to build trust with them, be patient, and go slow. They like routine and dependability. They will need a yard with a privacy fence, no other dogs and absolutely no cats or other small prey animals â after living on the streets the prey drive is strong for small furry critters. Carol is the cuddly joker of the pair and enjoys a good snuggle on the sofa. She is often the first to greet you and strangers, and will do anything for a treat. She loves to have her belly rubbed and will flip over in the yard or house and just lay there until provided with a good scratch. Mama Bear is and was the leader of the crew. She commands respect in a calm presence and isnât afraid to let out a big bark if she gets nervous about someone or something. She keeps her distance from new people, but with the help of Carol usually starts to trust a little sooner. She likes to sit on the sofa too, but isnât overly cuddly, although she does love to be calmly brushed and petted. It is estimated that they are roughly 4 to 5 years old. Both Mama Bear and Carol are up to date on shots, have been spayed and are current on flea, tick and heart worm prevention. They sleep well in their crates too and love to lay in the sun. They dislike fireworks or any loud noises. They must be adopted as a pair. If you have additional questions about this special pair or to setup a meet and great please email their foster Becky at carter.m.becky@gmail.com. There is an application here on our page or can be downloaded from our website or email us at rbynsnest@yahoo.com. You can also see more photos and see their evolution on their foster mom's Facebook page Facebook.com/BarneysBackyard."

*If you are not in the middle Tennessee area, transport can potentially be arranged to approved homes, depending on distance. We normally do not allow adoptions outside of 2 hours driving distance due to limited resources and difficulty ensuring the right match, especially if there are already animals in the home.Â 



**PLEASE NOTE: We are a non-profit organization without municipal or government funding. Veterinary/Medical expenses are constant for an animal rescue. Our adoption fees not only help to provide vetting and care for the animal being adopted, but they also help to cover heartworm treatments and other treatable ailments that many animals, that would otherwise be euthanized, need in order to be made available for adoption.


Please understand that adopting an animal is a LIFETIME COMMITMENT to that animal and there will be veterinary expenses throughout their life that can often cost several hundreds, if not thousands of dollars (without pet insurance), especially without annual checkups and preventative care.Â  As a potential family for this pet you are responsible for their safety and that includes keeping them on your property.

She came to us as a stray from the Williamsburg MO area. She was emaciated, weak, and near death. Liberty has been treated for a bacterial and yeast skin infection at the UMC Veterinary Hospital. She has improved but still has hair loss on her muzzle and tail that may never grow back. Liberty's condition was the worst of the 5 dogs we rescued so her therapy has been more involved, Liberty had a tin can stuck on her muzzle for days while she was homeless. Liberty may need ongoing treatment for her skin conditions. She may not be the most beautiful dog on the outside, but inside she has an endearing spirit and a loving heart. Liberty is a very happpy dog now that she is healing from her horrible skin problems and is not sitting at death's door. Liberty is house trained and knows how to use a doggy door, and she loves kids, dogs, and cats. Leash walking is a challenge for Liberty but she is making progress every day. To be considered for adoption of Liberty you MUST have access to a securely fenced yard. Liberty's adoption fee is $125 and a home visit is required before final approval.

Meet Spring! She's 1 year old, a svelte 65 lbs, and has beautiful green eyes and a luxurious white coat. Do you like going on outdoor adventures? Spring is your girl! She is full of personality and just wants to have fun. She's quite an athlete and shows her love for outings by throwing her paws up and flashing you a huge smile.

After a long day of exploring, she loves nothing more than to snuggle on the couch. She'll nuzzle her way into your lap, and before you know it, you have a giant white lap dog.

Spring is a smarty pants and likes to stay busy, so puzzles, training, and exercise are a must for this girl, otherwise she can become a little mischievous if left unsupervised. She is crate trained on command, but would prefer to be where the action is.

Spring is looking for a home with a secure 6 ft wood fence (as she is a bit of an escape artist and can climb wire fencing) and a confident playful canine sibling. She would thrive as part of an active family that will take her on daily runs, walks, hikes, and adventures. Spring is located in Woodinville, WA.

All our dogs require secure VISIBLE fencing.
PUPPIES WILL ONLY BE PLACED IN HOMES WITH YOUTHFUL, PLAYFUL, DOGS. This helps integrate the dog into your household easier by giving the pup a mentor.

Adoption Fee: $375

NOTE: Northwest adopter pays cost of transport to an independent transport company.

Pet Helpers is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foster based volunteer rescue located in Fairmont, WV. We do adopt out of state to approved applicants, if you are willing to drive to WV to pick up your pet. We do not fly or use transport companies. Our adoption fee is $150.00 for mixed breed puppies and adult dogs, $225.00 for full blooded puppies and adult dogs and $50.00 for cats and kittens. Regardless if the animal is a mixed breed or full blooded they are spayed/neutered prior to adoption IF they are old enough. If they are too young at the time of adoption, then it is your financial responsibility to spay/neuter the pet by the age of 6 months and you must provide proof for our files that it has been done. All of our pets are checked by a vet, given the shots appropriate for their age and any other treatment deemed necessary by the vet. All of our pets are adopted as indoor pets and are not be outdoors tied to a box 24/7. The pet you are adopting has been living in a home with a foster family. You are expected to take possession of the pet you are applying for within a few days of application approval. This will enable us to accept another pet into that home. Because we are a rescue, and believe that spaying and neutering is crucial in stopping the reproduction of unwanted puppies/kittens and massive amounts of animals dying daily in shelters across the country, we expect any animal already in your home to be spayed/neutered. If for any reason you are unable to keep the pet you have adopted you are required to return them to Pet Helpers, Inc. They are not to be sold or given away.

Check us out on Facebook!!!!!! We hope you will give us two paws up, like our page and share with your friends. Pet Helpers, Inc."

This super cute guy is Trapper!! Poor Trapper came to us in pretty bad shape. He has scars and part of his lower lip is missing. But that doesn't keep this boy d
own. We are guessing Trapper to be approx 5 and weighs about 25lbs. He is such a sweet loving boy! He is all about cuddling with his human. Trapper is so happy go lucky! He gets along ok with other dogs, but he can be a bit growly if they get in his space. He is crate trained and now that he is neutered doing much better with the housebreaking. A fenced in yard and being let out frequently is helping him get it! Trapper wants nothing but a comfy couch to hang out on. With a loving family.

Hi!! My name is Maggie, I am a spayed dachshund and I am 8 years old and 12lbs, my foster mom says \""every girl needs her very own chihuahua\"" and guess what I have my very own attached to me at all times!! His name is Enzo, he is 11, neutered and I am his best friend, he follows me every where. I could probably do my own thing and live my life without him but I am not sure what he would do without me. I do love him and if he cries I am right there to make sure he is ok and lick his face, he isnt really as much of a social butterfly as I am but if I am around he does ok, so we must be adopted together! We both really like to snuggle under the covers with our person at night and I Maggie am happy to say I am house trained, we do well in a crate as long as we are together. We have been vaccinated, wormed, flea treated and micro chipped and we are just looking for that special someone willing to take on both of us, Enzo is going to need a little convincing, he just got used to our foster mom, but with some time an patience I think we would make perfect family members! If you would like to make us part of your family you can fill out an application at https://www.pethelpersinc.org/adoption-application our adoption fee is 300.00 we are being fostered in Morgantown WV

My name is Ethel Jane Starr. Apparently the other ladies at the senior home are talking and accusing me of having fake hair. Ladies, the only thing fake about me is my first home. These Pearl's cost me 5 dog bones and two poops outside. I am currently available to the right person. My needs don't come cheap. Think about vet care, my hair, my nails, jewels, and most importantly food! I like my fine dining. My age is in the double digits. I cant see or hear very well, but once I get used to your layout I am golden. I like to keep my bathroom habits private, but I know you are going to ask. Sometimes I take it outdoors or sometimes I take a poop on the pad. No depends for me yet. My foster mom says I am very loveable. I'm not very clingy or cuddly though. Unless you bride me with the lucky charm marshmallows. I like to take lots of naps on the local beds. I get along ok with the other seniors at the center and ignore the cats.

When you're alone, and life is making you lonely

You can always go

Starrtown

When you've got worries, all the noise and the furry

Seems to help, I bark

Starrtown Just listen to the music of the furries in the pound

Linger on the sidewalk where the stars in the sky are pretty

How can you lose?

The lights are much brighter there

You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

So go starrtown, things'll be great when you're

Starrtown, no finer place for sure

Starrtown everyone's waiting for you!

Miss Petula Bark Starr is waiting for you at Starrtown! Petula would like a quiet home with no kids.

She does ok with other dogs, but would love to be the only child or with another laid back dog.

She does have a little food aggression, but who would want someone else touching their food.

Petula is a sweet girl. She is a little timid at first, but she knows you have to be cautious of people these days.

Petula takes Zonisamide twice day for seizures. Her seizures activity is low.

Little Miss Petula prefers to use pee pads, but loves the great outdoors if it is nice out.

Just a little picky about her bathroom choices, but peeing in the cold or rain is not a likely choice for any girl.

We believe Petula is 6 to 8 years old. This middle-aged looker still has lots of likes and licks left.

My name is Daenerys (Daeny for short) and I am a Beagle/Pit mix about 5 years old weighing 45 pounds. I came to Pet Helpers with my 6 surviving pups and 2 other adult dogs that were my pack. I am an alpha female and it was my responsibility to bring them back food if I could find it and protect them. Some really nice folks followed me home one night and made it possible for ALL of us to be rescued. My puppies have all been adopted into wonderful homes and now it's my turn to find my Forever Family. I've been spayed, microchipped, updated on vaccines and tested negative for heartworm and Lyme. I'm house trained and crate trained, but I really don't need a crate...I'm a pretty laid back kind of gal. When I meet a new dog I have to be introduced properly and spend some time with them to feel comfortable. Because of this I do not do well in a dog park or out walking with other dogs I do not know. I don't like cats, I'll be perfectly honest with you. I love kids and adults though and love to give kisses. I'm easy to leash walk and I really like car rides. If you could please open your heart and home to me, I promise to be loyal and loving. I am fostered in Fairmont, WV, and my adoption fee is $150.00.

So she made the trip from Cincinnati to Youngstown where she slid into foster home easily.

This girl weighs about 7 1/2 pounds and is fully vetted. She just had a dental so she's much more pleasant to be around. :)  We're really just learning about her.

She's learning to be her foster mom's \""chair Chi\"" and is finding her place in the pack. She's a bit nervous and reserved at first, but once she's used to her situation she is a very friendly, sweet girl. She's good with other small dogs and so-so with cats. She would probably prefer a home without a cat, but once properly introduced to one, she should be OK. 

She is crate trained, but during feeding times is very vocal. During that time, she sounds like a wild animal or bird from a jungle. Right before and after feeding you wouldn't think she was a Chihuahua. Other than that, she's pretty good in a crate.

We're working on house training. She will potty outside, but her potty breaks need to be consistent. She loves her basket and blanket, and loves sleeping (like all seniors do!)

Callie would like a quieter household with her own personal human to love and bond with. She's a good little guard Chi who wants a home that she can protect when called upon. She wants regular feeding (and peanut butter snacks!!!) and chair time so she can feel close to her person.

**Callie is being fostered in Youngstown, OH**

Callie's adoption fee is $250. If she sounds like the dog of your dreams please contact Chihuahua Rescue & Transport and she will pack her toys and love and be there in a wag of her tail.

If you would like more information about adopting this dog, please go to our website(www.chihuahua-rescue.org). All dogs listed are adoptable in the 10 Midwestern states(OH/IN/KY/IL/MN/MI/WI/PA/IA/MO). We do transport! All of our dogs are spread out throughout the Midwest in foster homes.
